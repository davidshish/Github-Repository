which is Di?e??ourid Of in

them, and of Lo?ing the

to Philo?ophy as Piety ,

with what Cautions, Arguments
may be ?ram'd upon the ?uppo?ition
of Finalcau?es ? X
sECnr.
v O begin with the fir? Ve?i
on; Tho?e that would ex
clude Final Cau?es from the con?i
deration ofthe Naturali?, are wont
to do it ( for ought I have ob?erv'd)
upon one of the?e two Accounts :
Either , that with Epimms they
> think the world was the Production
o? Atoms and Chance,without any
intervention of a Deity; and that
con?equently 'tis improper and in
vain to ?eek for Final Cau?es in the
effects of Chance: Or, that they
judge with De-s Caries, that God
being an Omni?cient Agent, 'tis
_ ra?h and Pre?umptuous for men to
B 2 , think,
( 4' 3
think, that they know',- or can in:
ve?igate, what Ends he propos'd
to him?elf in his Acti'ngs a about his
Creatures. The Ground on which
the Epz?imredm' have rejected Final
Cau?es, has been di?allow'd by the
Phil'o?ophers of almo? all other
Sects ; and ?ome have written ?uffi
cient Con?utations of ite, which
therefore I ?hall here forbear to in
?i? on ;. though ?omethings I?hall '
upon occafion ob?erve, that may
help, if not ?uffice, to di?credit ?o
unrea?onable an Opinion. But the
Carte?ian Argument hasbeen ?o pre
valent among many Learned and
Ingenious men, that it will be
worth while (if it be but to excite
better Pens) to ?pend ?ome time in
the con?ideration of it.
Perhaps one thing that alienated
that excellent Philo?opher, from
allowingthe con?ideration o?Fiml
Cau?es in Phy?icks, was, that the
School?iPhilolbphers , and many *
other Learned men, are wont to
' ' Pro
( s 3
Propo?i: it too unwarily, as if there
were no Creature in the world that
was not ?olely,0r at lea? chiefly, de
?ign'd for the Service or Bone-fit of
Man : in?omuch thatI remember I
have ?een a Body of Divinity, pub.
ii?h'd by a famousWriter,\Vherein,
to prove the opinion he ,£a_vou_rs,of
tho?e that 'would have the-world
annihilated after the day of Judge
ment, he'urgeth this Argument;
That ?ince theWorld was made for
the lake of Man in his travelling
- Condition ( homimctwizztoris ma?a,) ,
when once Man is po??e?i'd of his
Everlafiing State of Happine?s or '
Mi?ery ,' there will be no further
u?eoftheWorld. The opinion,
that gives ri?e to ?uch pre?umptiu
ous and unwarrantable Expre?iions,'
did, asI g?iuefi by his objection,
more choqze De: Cartes, thanI won
oder that it ?hould di?plea?e him;
But the indicretion of men ought
not. to prejudice Truth ; which
mu? not be ca? away, with the un
H 3 wait
(6)
warrantable Conceits that ?ome
men have _ pmn'd upon it.
Wherefore, ?ince I cannot entire
ly clo?e, either with the opinion of
the Epicuredm, or of the Carte?ian',
I ?hall leave each party to maintain
its ownfiopiniomand proceed to pro
po?e mine t' For the clearing of
which,'and indeed of the Diiqui
?ition Of Find! Czm?zs, I ?hall beg
leave to premi?e a Di?inction ,
which, though novel, I ?hall ven;
ture to employ,beca_u?e it compri?es
and di?ingui?hes ?ome things ,
which I think, ought neither to be
overlook'd nor confounded.
' Iconceive then, that when we
?peak of the Ends which Nature, or
rather the Author ofNature,is ?aid
to have in things Corporeal, One
of the?e four things may be ?igni
fy'd, or, if youlike that expre??ion
better, the End de?ign'd by Nature
may be four?old :
Fir?,
-( 7þ)
?? Fir?, there may be ?ome grand
and General Ends of the Whole
World, ?uch as the Exerei?ing and '
Di?playing the Creators immen?e
Power and admirable Wi?dom, the
Communication of his Goodne?s,
and the Admiration and Thanks
due to- him from, his Intelligent
Creatures, for the?e his divine Ex
cellencies, who?e Productions ma
ni?e? his Glory. And the?e Ends,
becau?e they regard the Creation of
the whole univer?e, Icall the'vm'z
ver?e] End: of God or Nature.
Secomlly, in a ?omewhat more
re?rain'd ?en?e, there may be Ends
defign'd in the number, fabrick,
placing, and wayes of moving the
'great Ma??es of Matter, that, for
their Bulks or Walities, are con
?iderable parts of the World 3 ?ince
'tis very probable,that the?e bodies,
?uch as the Sun, Moon, and fixed
Stars, and the Terraqueous Globe,
and perhags each of its two X chie£
13 4 i Parts
es)
parts, the Earth and the Sea, were
?o fram'd and plac'd, as not 'onlyto '\
be capable of per?evering in their
own pre?ent ?ate, but al?o as was
mo? conducive to the univer?al
Ends of the Creation, and the
good of the Whole World, whereof
they are notable parts. upon
which account the?e Ends, ma ,
for di?inctions lake, be call'd Ca?
mind or sy?emztiml, as regarding
the Symmetry of the great Sy?em
of the world. - '
There is a Third ?ort ofEnds,that
do more peculiarly concern the
'Parts of Animals ( and probably
Plants 'too ) which are tho?e, that
the particular parts of Animals are
de?inated to,and for the welfareof
the whole -- imalhim?el?, as he is
an entire an' di?inct SyPtem of or
?ianiz'd parts, de?inated to pre
?erve him?elf vand propagate his
Species, upon ?uch a Theatre (as
the Land,._'_Water or Air) as his
Ytructuire and Circum?tances de?i
' * ' ' " termine
(9)
termine him to act his part on. And
the?e Ends, to di?criminate them
from others, may be call'd Animal
Ends.
Fowl-My, and la?ly, there is an
other ?ort of Ends, which, becau?e
they relate particularly toMan,may,
for brevity's ?ake, be call'd Human
Ends, which are tho?e that'are
aim'd at by Nature, where ?he is
?aid to frame Animals and Vege
tables , and other of her producti
ons, for the u?e of Man. And the?e
Ends them?elves may be di?in
gui?h'd iuto Zl?entzt?l, that relate to
His Mind, and corporeal, that re
late to His Body,not only as He is
an Animal fram'd like other Ani
mals, for his own Pre?ervation,
and the propagation of his Species
(Mankind;) but al?o asHe is
fram'd for Dominion over other
Animals and works of Nature,
and fitted to make them ?ub?iervi
ent to the De?inations, that one
mayl?u'ppoleto have been made;
o
he)
of them to His ?ervice and benefit, _
This Di?inction of Fine! Cau?es,
which I hope will not prove alto
gether u?ele?s, being premis'd; I
?hall begin my intended Di?cour?e,
by owning a di??ent from both the
oppo?ite Opinions; Their-s, that,
with the vulgar of Learned Men,
will take no notice of Final Cau?es
but tho?e we have ?iled Human
ones; and theirs, that (as they
think, with De?cartes ) reject Fi
nal Cau?es altogether; ?ince,'tho'
I judge it erroneous to ?ay in the
?ricte?i ?en?e, that every thing in
the Vi?ible World, was made for
the u?e of Man', yet I think 'tis
more erroneous to deny, that any
thing was made for ends Inve?i=
gable by Man. '
'Tis a known Principle of the
Carte?ian Philo?ophy , That-there
is always ju? the ?ame quantity of
Motion in the World at'one time,
thatthere at another: Of which
A??et'
U')
. A??ertion this Rea?on is given;
That there is no Cau?e, Why God,
who is Immutable, ?hould at the
beginning of things, when he fir?
put Matter into Motion, have gi
ven it ?uchxa quantity of Motion,
as would need to be afterwards
augmented or le??enct'd. But I ?ee
not, how by this Negative way
of Arguing, tho?e that imploy it,
do not ? implicitly at-lea?) take
upon them to judge of the Ends,
that God may have propos'd to
him?elf in Natural things. For,
without a Suppo?ition, that they
know what God de?ign'd in let
ting Matter a-moving , 'tis hard
for themto ?hew, that His De?ign
s could not be ?uch, as might be be?
accompli?h'd by ?ometimes adding
to, and ?ometimes taking from, the
Wantity of Motionhe communi
cated to Matter at fir?. And I
think it may be worth con?ider
ing, Whether by this Doctrine of
theirs, the Carte?ian: do not more
take upon them than other Philo.

to be very Wi?e, and have vari

tho?e ways have a direct tenden
cy to ?ome Rational End, ' ?hall
conclude That End to-be one of
tho?e that is intended, does there:

re?pect to that Wi?e Man, than he
that ?hould conclude, that tho?e
cannot be his Ends, and that He
can have no other De?ign knows.

per, may be among otherr, intend

that he can have no other t an ?uch
or ?uch an End. ' ' "
And how Will a Carte?ian a??uke

( 13 )
that he grants that God 'may have

may not as well be Immutable,
tho' he ?hould ?ometimes vary the

put into the World, as He is, tho',
according to the Opinion of mo?
of the Carte?ian: them?elves , he
does daily create multitudes of Ra

' ing, that the?e newly created ?ub
?ances, are, according to Des
Certes, endow'd with a power, to

ons of the Spirits and the Camrz'
on ; which are things clearly Cor
poreal; I ?ay 'not this, as if I ab
?olutely rejected the Carte?ian Do
ctrine, about the Continuance of
the ?ame (Mantity of Motion in the
whole Ma?s of Matter. For, whe
ther or no it be aTruth; I think
'tis no unu?e?ul nor improbable

_ ( 15 )
, Wherefore, to come now to the
i thing it ?elf ,- whereas Mon?ieur
Des-Cartes objects, that 'tisa Pre
?umption for Man, to pretend to
be able to inve?igate the Ends,
that the Omni?izienr God propos'd
to him?elf in the making of his
Creatures ; -I con?ider by way of
An?wer, That there are two very
differin ways, whereina Man may
' preten to know the Ends of God
in his vi?ible Works: For, he may
either pretend to know only ?ome
eof God's Ends, in ?ome of his
' zWorks ;* Zor, he may pretend to
rknow all his Ends. Hev that arro
--'gates to him?elf, to di?cover God's
2 Ends in this latter ?en?e, will ?carce
be excus'd-?rom a high Pre?iimp
tion, and no ?s aFolly, from the
rea?on lately'v timate'd in the Car
tefiw Objection. But to pretend
t?io know God's-'Ends in the former
?en?e, is not a P're?umptz'ozz, but
rather, to'take notice of them is a
Bury. For, there are ?ome things
in Nature ?o curioufly contrivedd,
an
ct( 1 6 )
and ?o exqui?itly fitted for certain'
Operations and U?es, that it ?eems
little le?s than Blindne?s in Him,
that acknowledges with the Carte
?mm a mo? wi?e Author of things,
not to conclude, that, tho' they
may have been de?ign'd for other,
and perhaps higher u?es ; yet they
were de?ign'd for this U?e. As he,
that ?ees the Admirable Fabric of
the Coats, Humors, and Mu?cles
of the Eyes, and how-excellently
all- the v'parts are adapted to the
making up of an Organ of Vi?ion,
can ?carce forbear to believe, that
the Author of Nature intended It
rlhould'?erve the Animal, to which
it belongs, toSee with. The Epi
cuream indeed , that believe the
World to have been. produc'd but
by the ca?ual conccnr?e of Atoms,
without the interve i'on of any In
telligent?iBeing, may have a kind
of excu?e, whereof other Philo?o
phers are' de?itute, 'that acknow
?i ledge a Deity, it not al?o a Provi
dence. Forthe very Suppofition,
- ' - ' . for
( 17 )
for in?ance,-that a mans Eyes were
made by Chance,argues, that they
need have no relation to a, defign
ing Agent ; and the u?e that aman
makes of them , may be either
ca?ual too, or at lea? may be- an
effect of His knowledge, not of zVa
Mre's. But when, upon the Ana
tomical Di??ection, and the Optical
con?ideration, of a Human Eye,we
?ee 'tis as ex'qui?itly ?itted to be an
Organ of Sight,as the be? Artificer
in the world could have fram'd a
little Engine, purpo?ely and mainly
de?ign'd for the u?e of ?eeing ; 'tis
very har?h and incongruous to ?ily,
that an Artificer , who is too intel
ligent either to do things by chance,
or to make a curious piece of work
man?hip without knowing what
- , u?es 'tis fit for, ?hould not de?ign
it for an u?e to which 'tis mo? fit.
'Tis not tobe deny'd that he may
have more u?es for it than one, vand
perhaps ?uch u?es as we cannot di
vine; but this hinders not,but that,
C among

among its ?everal u?es , this, to
which wei?ee it ?o admirably a
dapted, ?hould be thought one.
And I?ee not, how it does magni
?ie Gods wi?dom,_or expre?s our
Veneration o?it, to exclude out of
the number of his Ends in ?raming
Human Eyes, that mo? obvious
and ready u?e which we are ?ure is
made of them , and which they
could not be better fitted for. This
may perhaps be not un?itly illu?ra
ted by the following Compari?on,
whereof the application were ?u
perfluous: Suppo?e that a Coun
try Man , being in a clear day
brought into the Garden of ?ome
famous Mathematician, ?hould ?ize
there, one of tho?e curious Cno
monick In?ruments, that ?how at
once, the place of the Stm in the
Zpdiack, his Declimztian from the
zflqmtor, the Day of the Month,
the Lengtb ofthe Day, &c. It- would
indeed be pre?umption in him, be
ing unacquaintcd, both with the
Mathematical Di?ciplines, and the
?everal
( l9 )
?everal Intentions of the Arti?, to
pretend or think him?elf able, to
di?cover all the Ends, for which ?o
(furious and Elaborate a Piece
was framed. But when he ?ees it
furni?hed with a Stile, with Ho
rary Lines and Numbers, and in
?hort, with all the Requi?ites of a
Sun Dial, and manife?ly perceives
the shadow to mark from time
time, the Hour of the Day;
'twould be no more a Pre?umpti
on than an Error in him to con.
clude, that (whatever other u?es
the In?rument is fit, or was de
?ign'd for) it is a Sun-Diet, that
was meant to ?hew the Hour of
the Day.
And here I?hall demand of
tho?e, that will not allow us to
think, that any Natural Things
are directed to Ends knowable by
Men', whether, if the Divine Au
thor of them had really de?ign'd
them for ?uch Ends, the things
them?elves are not ?o Fram'd and
C I Dij
, 20 )
directedza's in that ca?e' they ?hould
be? And whether the Fabrick and
Management of Natural Things,
do really countenance or contradict
our Suppo?ition P
For my part , after what has
been already di?cours'd, I ?cruple
not to confe?s, thatl ?ee not why
it ?hould be reputed a Di?parage
ment to the Wi?dom of any Agent
what?oever, to think, ' that his Pro
ductions were de?ign'd for ?uch
Emlr, among others, 'as they are
excellently' fram'd and fitted for; '
unle?s it did appear, that tho?e
Ends were unworthy to be De
fign'd by the Wi?e Agent. But
that cannot be ju?ly ?aid in our
pre?iant Ca?e ; ?ince 'tis not injuri
ous to the Divine' Author of things,
to believe that ?ome of the Ends,
to which he de?inated divers of
his Corporeal Works, were; To
exert and communicate His Exus
berant Goodne?s, and to receive
from his intelligent Creatures, ?uch -
as
(2\)
as Men, ari ardent Love, ahigh
. Admiration, and an ob?equious
Gratitudez, for having di?play'd ?o
much Wi?dom and Beneficence, in
exqui?itly guali?ying'his Works
to be wonderfully ?erviceable to
one another, and a great number
of them to beparticularly ?ub?er

he adds, ( by which he ?eems to
intimate the motive that led him
to make the foremention'd A??er;
tion,) That in Phy?icks, all things
ought to be made out by certain
and ?olid Rea?ons; to this I an
?wer, Fir?, That I ?ee not why

others, may not con?i? with the

have that intended u?e in his Eye,
whil? he Explicates the Fabrick
and Operations of the Watch. I
an?wer , Seeorzdly, That I rea
dily admit, that in Phy?icks Awe
?hould indeed ground all things
upon as ?olid Rea?ons as may be
had; But I ?ee no nece??ity, that
tho?e Rea?ons ?hould be always
preci?ely Phy?ical: E?pecially if
We be treating, not of' any parti
cular Phwmmenon, that is prod uc'd
according to the cour?e of Nature
e?ablj?h'd in the World, already
con?ituted as this of ours is: but
of the fir? and general Cau?es of
the World it ?elf; from which
Cau?es, I ?ee not why the Final
Cau?es, or u?es, that appear ma
ni?e?ly enough to have been de
?ign'd, ?hould be excluded. And
to me 'tis not very material, Whe
ther or no, in Phy?icks or any o
ther Di?cipline, athing be prov'd
by the peculiar Principles of that
Science or Di?cipljne; provided it
be firmly proved by the common
\ ' C 4 grounde
' <24)
grounds of Rea?on. And on this
occa?ion let me ob?erve, that the
Pundamental Tenents of Mr. Der
Cartes's own Philo?ophy, are not
by him?elf prov'd by Arguments
?rictly Phyfical; but either by
Metaphy?ical ones, or the more
Catholick Dictates of Rea?on', or
the particular te?imonies of Ex
perience. For when, for in?ance,
he truly a?cribes to God ,all the Mo
tion that is found in Matter; and
con?equently, all the variety of'
Phwhomem that occur in the
World; he proves not by an Ar
gument preci?ely Phy?ical, that
God, who lS an Immaterial Agent, _
is the efficient cau?e of Motion in
M?iantcteerM;otbiuotn odnoleys bnyotthbiesl,onTghatto r

to ?ome other Being: And then
'tis mo? agreeable to common Rea
?on, to infer, that, ?ince Matter
cannot move it ?elf, but it mu? be
rnov'd by ?ome other Being, that
' . ' - ' Be;
(2s)
* DeJ-Cartes does, as
Being mu? be Immaterial, ?ince
otherwi?e ?ome Matter mu? be
able to move it ?elf contrary to the
l-lypothe?is. And when Des-Cartes
goes to demon?trate, that there is
'always in the univerle, the ?elf
?ame quantity of Motion, (that
is , ju?t as much at any one
time, as at any other) and con
?equently , that _as much, motion
as one Body communicates to ano
ther, it loo?es it Half; he proves it;
by the lmmutabillty of 'God,which
is not a Phy?ical Argument?rictly
?o call'd, but rather a-Metaphy?ical
One; as he formerly prov'd, God's
being the Cau?e of all Motion in
Matter, not by Principles peculiar
to Phyficks, but by the common
grounds of Rea?on. *

Opinion who teach, that God hath
no other End in making the World,
but that of being prais'd by Men.
But in that ?hort Di?cour?e where
of this Pa??age is a part, there are
two or three other things wherein
Icannot Acquie?ce. As fir?, that
itis self-evident, that we cannot
know the Ends of God, unle?s he
Himlelf reveal them to us; ( he
mu? mean in a Supernatural way,
if he will not ?peak impertinent
ly z) For what he ?ays to be evis
dent of it ?elf, is not at all ib, to
the generality of Mankind, and
even of' Philo?iophers; and there
fore I think, 'it ought not to be
barely pronounc'd, but ( if it can
be) ?hould be prov'd. And next,
he does not ?how how we are ob<
lig'd to prai?e God for his Works,
if He had no intention tohave us
do ?o, or that we ?hould di?cover
any of the Ends for. which He
made them, If a judicious Man
?hould ?ee a great Book, writtenin
fidme Indian Language, which he
(23)
is utterly a stranger to, and?hould
know nothing of it, but that 'twas
made by a very Intelligent Phy?i
cian: He might indeed conclude,
that the Work was not made '
by chance, but would have no
means to be convinc'd by'the In
?pection- of the Book it ?lf, that
it was compos'd with great Skill
and Kindne?s, and de?erv'd his
Prai?e and Thanks .- Since he could
not know any of the particular
Ends, to which the ?everal Chap
ters of it; were de?inated, nor con
fiequently di?cover how skilfully'
they were fitted to reach?uch
Ends. MWhat Der-Carter \ays,*that
7tis childi?h and ab?urd to think,
that God had. created the Sun,
'whichois many times bigger than
the Earth, 'only to afford Light to
Man, who is but a very ?mall part
of It, is ?omewhat invidioully pro
pos'd ; there being 'few vabl-e Wri
ters, that confine the lltility of the
Sun directly to the affording Light
to Man; and the littlene?s of 'his
' ' Bulk,
(29l
'Caries not improbably thinks to be
Bul * , ought not to make it thought
ab urd, that God may have had an
e?pecial Eye to his Welfare, in fra
ming that bright Globe; ?ince not
only, for ought appears to us, that,
mott excellent Engine of Mans
Body, is a more admirable thing
than the Sun, but the rational and
immortal Soul that re?ides in it, is
incomparably more noble than a
thou?and Ma??es of brute Matter,
and that not ?o much as Organiz'd,
can be ju?ly reputed, (as will be
hereafter more fully declared.)And
?ince in this very Di?izour?e, the
accute Author of it confe??es, that
we may know the ends of God's
Corpor????eal Works, if He reveal
them to us; a Chri?ian Philo?o
pher may be allow'd, to think the
Sun was made, among other ur
po?es, to inlighten the Earth, and
for the u?e of Man, ?ince the
Scripture teaches us, that not only
the Sun and Moon, but the stars
of the Pirmament, which Der
?o
lao)
?o many Suns, were made to give'
Light to the Earth, and were divi
4 ded to all the Nati
1)?i6ut-4-19- ons that inhabit it.
Perhaps it were not
v ra?h to add, that I ?ee not why
the Belief, thata Man may know
?ome of God's Ends in things
Corporeal, ?hould more derogate
from our Veneration of his'
Wi?dom , than to think we
know ?ome of his Ends in other
Matters, of which the Scrip
ture furni?hes us with a mul
titude of In?ances, as (particu
Iarly) that of Job Facrificing for
his Friends 5 and the declar'd u?es
Of the 'Drz'm and Tlmmz'm: Since
God may , i? He plea?es , declare
Truths to Men, and in?ruct them,
by his Creatures and his Actions,
as well as by his Words : As when >
He taught Noah by the Rain-bow,
and Jomb by a Gourd and a
Worm, and regulated the Incamp
ment of the I?rzzelites, by the gui.
dance of a Cloud , and a fiery
Pillar;
(31 )
Pillar. La?ly , whereas Mon?ieur
Der-Carte: objects, that tho?e he
di??ents from, talk as if they look'd
upon God as a proud Man, who
de?ign'd his Works only to be
prais'd for them; I know not,
whether in this place he ?peaks ?o
cautioully and reverently of God,
as he ought, and el?ewhere, is -
wont to do. For as Humility, tho'
it be a Vertue in Men, is extreamly
remote from being any of Gods
Perfections, ?o That may be pride
in a Man,- who is but a Creature,
imperfect , dependent, and hath
nothing that he has not receiv'd;
which would be none at all in God,
who is uncapable of Vice, and who
may , if he plea?e, ju?ly propo?e
to him?elf His own Glory for one
of his Ends, and both require and
delight to be prais'd by Men for
his Works; ?ince he is mo? wor
thy of all prai?e, and 'tis their du
ty and rea?onable ?er-vice, which he
is graciou?ly pleas'd to approve of,
to pay it Him.

'Tis not without trouble, that I
find my ?elf oblig'd by the exigen.
cy of my de?ign, ?o much to op
po?e, in ?everal places of this pre
?ent Di?cour?e, ?ome Sentiments of
. Mr. Der-Carter, for whom other
wi?e I have a great e?eem, and
from whom I am not forward to
di??ent. And this I the rather de
clare to you, becau?e I am not at
all of Their mind, that think Mr.
Der-Carter a ?avourer of Athei?m,
which, to my apprehen?ion, would
?ubvert the very foundation of
tho?e Tenents of 'Mechanical Phi
lo?ophy, that are particularly his.- -
But judging that his Doctrine (at
lea? as it is under?ood by ?everal
of his Followers, as well as his Ad
verfitries ;) about the rejection of
Final Cau?es from the con?ideration
of Naturali?s, tends much to wca- -
ken, (as is el?ewhere noted) if
e not quite' to deprive us of, one of
the be? andrno? ?ucce?sful Argu
ments, to convince Men, that there.
lS

(3z)
is a God, and that they ought to
Admire, Praile, and Thank him:
I think vit my duty to prefer an irri
portant truth, before my re?pect
to any Man, how eminent ?oever,
that oppo?es it; and to con?ider
more the Glory of the great Au
thor of Nature, than the Reputa
tion of any one of Her Interpre
ters.
And to ?rengthen what I have
been ?aying, give me leave to mind
you more expre?iy here, of what
I have el?ewhere Intimated, w'z,
That the excellent contrivance of
the great, Sy?i?em of the World,
and e?pecially the curious Fabrick
of the Bodies of Animals, and the
u?es of their Sen?bries, and other
parts, have been the greatiMo
tives, that. in all Ages and Nati
ons induc'd Philo?ophers to a?ic
knowledge a Deity, as the Author
of the?i: admirable Structures; and,
that the Noble? and mo?' Intelli-v
gent Prai?es, that have been aid
D im
Z/
(34)
Him by the Prie?-s of Nature, have
been occa?ion'd and indited by the
F?ran?izending Admiration; which
the attentive Contemplation of the
Fabrick of the univer?iz and of the
curious Structures of Living Crea
tures , ju?ly produc'd in them.
And therefore it ?eems injurious to
God, as well as unwarrantable in
it ?elf, to bani?h from Natural
Philo?ophy , the Con?ideration of
Final Cau?es; from which chiefly,
a if not only, I cannot but think
( tho' ?ome Learned Men do other;
wile ) that God mu? reap the Ho
nour that is due to tho?e glorious
Attributes , his Wi?dom , and his
* Goodne?s. And I confe?s, I ?ome
What wonder, that the Carte?ian,
who have generally, and ?ome of
them skilfully, maintain'd the Ex.
i?ence of a Deity, ?hould endea
vour to make Men throw away an
Argument, which the Experience
of all Ages ?hews to have been the
mo? Succe?sful, (and in ?ome
Ca?es the only prevalent one j to
e?abli?h
(3s)
c?abli?h among Philo?o hers the
Belief and Veneration ofP God. I
know the Cartefians ?ay, That their
Ma?er has demon?rated the Ex
i?ence of a God, by the Izm'ate
Idea that Men have of a Being in
?initely perfect; who left it upon
the mind of Man, as the mark of
an Arti? impre? upon his War/e:
And al?o that they a?cribe to God,
the having made Matter out of
nothing, and alone put' it into Mo
tion; which ?ufficiently argue the
Immen?ity of his Power. But,
tho' I would by no means weaken
the Argument, drawn from the
Inbred Nation of God, ?ince I
know, that divers Learned Men;
have Acquie?c'd in it; yet, on the
other ?ide, I ?ee not, why we may
not rea?onably think, that God,
who, as them?elves confe?s, has
been pleas'd to take care, Men
?hould acknowledge Him , may
al?o have provided for the ?ecuring
of a Truth of ?o great Con?equence,
by ?amping Characters, or lea
D 2 ' ving
, (z6)
ving Impre??e??s, that Men may
know his -Wict?dom and Goodne'?s
by , aswell without, 'upon the l
World, as within, upon the .Miml.
The bare Speculation. of the Ea
vbrick of the World, without con
?idering any part of it as de?inated
to certain (or determinate) u?s,
may ?illlcave Men unconvinc'd,
that there is any intelligent, Wi?e,
and Provident Author and Di?po?er
of Things: Since we ?ee generally
the Ari?otelians ,,( before ?ome of
them were better In?ructed by the
Chri?ian Religion) did, notwith
?anding the E?ixtent, Symmetry,
and Beauty of the World,_*believe
it to have been Eternal. And tho'
They , whatever thei'ry Ma?er
thought, did not believe it to have
been Created by God; yet, be
cau?e they a??erted that Animals,
Plants, eke, act for Ends', they
were oblig'd to acknowledge a
Provident and Powerful Being, that
maintaiffid and govern'd the uni
ver?e, which they 'call'd Nature:
Tho'
(37)
_-,Th0' they too often dangerou?iy
mi?ook, by ?ometimes confound
ing this Being with God him?elf;
and at other times, ?peaking of it
; _. _ as CO-Qrdinate with'him, as in that
famousi Axiom of Ari?otle, Dear
6' Narum m'hz'l facz'aht?? fru?a. vI
acknowledge therefore, that, as I
?et a ju? value upon the Carte?ian
Proof of God's Exi?enee, ?bI ?ee
no'rea?on, why we '?hould disfur
ni?h our ?elves of- any other ?rong
Argument to prove ?onoble and
important a Truth ;__ e?pecially,
?ince the Carte?ian way of con?ider
ing the World, is very proper in
" 'deed to ?hew the Greatne?i of
God's Power, but not', 'like 'the
way I plead for, to manife? that
of his Wi?dom and Beneficence.
For, whereas a Carte?ian does but
?hew, that God is admirably Wife,
vupon the---- ?uppo?ition. of his Exi
?ence ; in our way, the ?ame thing
is manife?ed by the Effect of a
Wi?dom, as well as Power, that
cannot rea?onably be a?cribed to
'- D 3 any
(33)
any other, than a mo? intelligent
'and potent Being: So that by This
way, Men may be brought, upon
'the ?ame account, both to acknow
v ledge God, to admire Him, and to
thank Him.

given ?ome In?ances.
If it be objected, that if we allow
Chance, or any thing el?e, without
the particular Guidance of a wile
and All-di?po'?ing Cau?e, to make a
finely ?hap"d Stone, or a metalline
?ub?ance, growing, as I have ?ome
times ?een ?i/oer to do, in the form
of a Plant z it ought not to be de
nye'd, that Chance may al?o make
Vegetables and Animals: Ican by
no means allow the con?equence.
There are ?ome effects, that are ?o
ea?y, and ?o ready, to be produc'd,
that they do not infer any know
ledge 'or intention in their Cau?es; _
but there are others, 'that require
?uch a number 'and concour?e of
con?piring Cau?es, and ?uch a con
tinued flerzjet of motions or operati

they ?hoiild be produced without
the ?uperintendency of a Rational

to range and di?po?e the ?everal in

(46)
tervening Agent's and In?ruments,
after the manner requi?ite to the
production of ?uch a remote effect.
And therefore it will not follow,
that if Chance could produce a
?light contexture in a few parts of
matter 5 we may ?afely conclude it
able to produce ?o exqui?it and ad
mirable aContrivance, as that of
the Body of an Animal. What then,
if ?ometimes in ?awing pieces of va
riegated Marble, men happen, tho'
rarely, to meet with the Delineati
ons or Pictures (?ome of which
l have beheld with plea?ure) of
Towns, Woods, and Men? For,
be?ides that the plea?ingne?s and rit
rity of ?uch fpectacles inclines the
Imagination to favour them, and
?upply their defects; would any
wi?e man therefore conclude, that
a real Town or wood, much le?s
numbers of men, ?hould be made
by ?uch a forlxlitons concour?e of

betwixt the workman?hip that
?eems to be expre??ed in a few ir

the great multitude of Nerves,

fitw any Inanimate production of
Nature, or, as they ?peak, OFCbfflz/m,
who?e contrivance was compara
bie to that of the meane? Limb of

is incomparably more Art exprei's'd

And, tho' the Paw ofa Dog will
be confe?s'd, to be of a ?ructure far,
Inferior to that of the Hand of a

yet how little any of them could
have been ?par®d or alter'd,unle?s

I impute to the want ofuni?ormi
ty in the refraction of tho?e reflect
' ed beams of Light, that fall upon
the Cornea, who?e ?urface is not ?o
?mooth and equal as it ?hould be.
To give ?ome'further Proof, that
the Eye was made with de?ign,I
?hall here take notice of an ob?erva
tion or two, that do not occurr in
the di??ection of a human Eye, and
therefore' are not wont to be menti
oned by Anatomi?s.
I have ob?erved in Frogs, (asI
pre?um?ie ?ome others al?o may have
done) that, be?ides tho?e parts of
the Eye which they have in com
mon with Men, Dogs, Cats, and the
mo? part'o? other Animais, They
have a peculiar, whether mem
brane, or Cartilage, or both, which
ordinarily is not perceived ; "where
with they can at plea?ure cover the
Eye, without too much hindering
the' fight; becau?e this membrane
* ' * * lS
(sz)
is as well Tran?parent as ?rong;
?o that it may pa?s for a'kind of
moveable Cornea, and ( if I may ?o
call it) a kind of ?al?e-?cabord to
to the Eye. In furni?hing frogs
with this ?rong Membrane, the
Providence of Nature ?eems to be
con?picuous: For they being Am
phibious Animals, de?ign'd to pa?s
their lives in watery places, which
for the mo? part abound with
Sedges, and- other Plants endowed
with ?harp Edges or points; and
'the progreffive motion of this A
nimal being to be made, not by
walkingþut by leaping ; if his Eyes '
were not provided of ?uch a ?heath
as I have been mentioning, he mu?
either ?hut his' Eyes, and ?o leap
wholly, 'and by con?equence dange
rw?iy, or, by leaving them open,
mu? run a venture t'o have the
Cornea cut, prickt, or otherwi?e of'
fended, by the edges or points of
the Plants, or what may fall from
them' upon the Animals Ey'e'f
Whereas this Membrane, as was
' E 3 ?i ?aid,"
(..54)
?aid, is like a kind of Spectacle,that
covers the Eye without taking a
way the ?ight 5 and as ?oon as the
need of imploying it is pa?, the An
nimal at plea?iire withdraws it in
to a little Cell, where it Re?s out
of the way, till there be occa?ion
to u?e it again. This you may
?ee, if you apply the point of a pin,
or a Pen, or anyþ?uch ?harp thing,
'to the Eye of a frog, whil? you
hold his head ?eady : for to ?creen
his Eye, he willpre?ently cover it
(at lea? for the greate? part) with
this Membrane, which, when the
' danger is over, he will again with
draw. And, becau?e many, if not
mo?, ?orts of Birds, are wont or
de?inated to fly, (as more would
do if not kept tame) among the
Branches of Trees and Bu?hes;
lea? the Prickles, Twigs, Leaves,
or other parts ?hould wound or of
fend their Eye, Nature hath gi
ven Them likewi?e ?uch another
kind of horny Membrane,'as we
have been mentioning in frogs.

ality'?or ctum makes them Wil- l
lcti?ng to a?cribe the ?ructuresv' of
Animals rather to'v That, then to a;
de?igning Cau?e; will make them
draw an Objection, fit to' be 'here
obviated, again? our , Doctrine,
from what' we have ob?erv'd of
the difference between Human and
other Eyes:'Since vthey will pre
tend that all Organs of Sight ought 9
to be con?orrh'd to tho?e of Men,
as tho?e that are the be? and mo?
perfect. -1_Tis true, that Man be
' ' - 'vr ving -
( 57 )
ing ju?ly reputed the mo? perfect
of Animals, it is' not ?range that
he ?hould (as Men generally do)
pre?ume, that His Eyes and other _
parts ofv his Body, are the be?
contrivid of any that are to be
found in Nature. But yet I think
we cannot from hence ?afely con
clude, that all Eyes, which in other
Animals are of Structures differ
ing from tho?e of Man, are for that
rea?on defective. For I con?ider,
Fir?, That the admirable Wi?dom
di?play'd by the Author of Things,
in fitting the Eyes and other Or
ganical parts of Animals , for the
u?es that ?eem mani?e?ly to have
been de?ign'd in their Fabrick, and
for the re?pective Functions we
afitually ?ee them exerci?e, may
ju?ly per?uade us, that the things
who?e Rea?ons or u?es we do not
'alike di?cern, are yet mo? wi?ely
con?ituted: Such. an Author as
God, having too much knowledge
to doany thing unskilfully ; and
We having too much pre?umption,
fo if
(s8)
if we think He can have in' the
?taining of his Creatures, no Ends
that are beyond our Di?covery.
. "And, Setomlly, We may reprefiznt,
that the Eye is not to be Tcon?ider'd
ab?rafltedly as an In?rument of
Vi?ion, but as an In?rument be-"
longing to an Animal of this or .
that kind; and who is ordinarily
to-make u?e of it in ?uch and ?uch
4Circum?ances. And therefore I
.think it ought not at all vto Di?pa
Jage, but rather highly'Recom
amend, the-Wi?dom and Providence
' of the great Author of Things;
that he has furni?h'd various Spe
cz'er of Animals, with Organs of
Sight that are very diffcringly
fram'd and plac'd: Since this di
verlity nobly manife?s his great
Providence, and (if I may ?o call
it) Foreca?; that has admirably
?uited thoEyes of the differing
kinds of Animals, both to the re?
3 of their Bodies, and (which Ihere
_ mainly con?ider) to tho?e parts of
the great Theatre of the World,
' on
(s9) '
on which Hede?igns that theyv ?hall
live and act. Thus though divers
Bea?s, asiHorles, Oxen, and ?ome
others, have their Eyes furni?h'd
with a ?eventh Mu?cle, be?ides the
'?ix they have in common with
Men ; we mu? not conclude, ei
ther that the Organs of Vi?ion are
Imperfect in Men, or that tho?e of
the?e Bea?s l'l'ave ?omething ?upers
fluous. For Hor?esflm being to feed
for the mo? part on gra?s and herbs
of the Field, and, that they may
the better chu?e their Food, being
oblig'd to make their Eyes look ve
ry long downwards; the Seventh
Mu?cle does excellently ?erv-e them
to do ib, without that wearine?s,
which, if they were not ?urni?h'd
with It, that durably con?rain'd
Po?ure would be ?ure to give them:
Whereas Man, who has no ?uch ne
ce??ity of looking affiduou ?ly down
wards, would be but incumber'd
by a Seventh Mu?cle.
l
On
' (6o)
On the other ?ide, the defective-J
ne?s ob?ervable in the Eyes of ?ome
Animals, in compari?on of tho?e
of Man , may be a?crib'd to the
thriftine?s (if Imay ?o ?peak) of
Nature, that, on mo? occa?ions,
declines doing that?i which is not
?i nece??ary to the particular Ends,
She aims at in the F'abriek of a
- Part.- Thus Moles' being de?ign'd
to live for the mo? part under
Ground, the Eyes which Nature
hath given them, are ?o little, in
proportion to their Bodies, that
'tis commonlybeliev'd, and even
by ?ome Learned' Men maintain'd,
they have none at all. But tho' by
Anatomy, I, as well as ?ome others
that have t-ry'd, have found the
Contrary ; yet their Eyes are very
differing from tho?e of other Fo'ur
footed Bea?is. Which is not to be
wonder'd at; con?idering, that the
de?ign of Nature was, that Mole:
?hould live under Ground, where p
a Sight was needle?s and u?ele?s ; .
and where greater Eyes would be
more'
( 61 )
inore expos'd to danger 2 And
their Sight, as dim as 'tis,-' isfiifi
ficient to make them perceive that
they are no longer under Ground,
(at lea? ?o as they are wojnt'to be)
which ?eems to be the mo? nece?
?ary u?e they have of Light 'and
Eyes.

able to frame both Clocks, and
Watches, and Ships, and Rockets,

far greater Skill in an' Arti?icer,
than he could di?play in making but
one of tho?e ?orts of Engines, how
arti?icially ?oever he contriv-'d it.
And the flame ?uperiority of know-v
ledge would'be di?play'd, by con
triving Engines of the ?ame kind,or
for the fame purpo?es after very dif
fering manners." As Weights indeed'

Famous Clock'of Stm?bnrg ; and
' " therefore
(67)
therefore it recommends the Inven
tors of Watches, not only that they
can make Clocks of a very little
and ea?ily portable Bulk, which the
Stra?hnrg Machine is not, but can
make a Clock without weights, and
by means of a Spring perform
their Office. And thus,tho* to fly,
it ?eems ab?olutely nece??ary that
an Animal ?hould be furni?ht with
Feathers; the Wife Creator hath
?hewn that he is not confin'd to
make u?e of them for that purpo?e :
?ince a Flying Fi?h is able to move
a great, way in the Air; and the
Indies have lately furni?ht us with
a?ort of flying Squirrils (whereof
I?aw one alive at 'White-Hall. j
And tho' the flight of the?e is not
long, yet there is another kind of
Animals without Feathers that can
fly long enough, namely the Batt ,
tho' ?ome of the?e, as I have ?een,
be little le?s then Hens : and Ihave
been a??urd by a credible Eye-wit

And now, to give you the Sun?
mary of my Thoughts, about the
Second (De?ion ; I. I' think, that
from the Ends and u?es of the
Parts of Lia/ing Bodies, the Natu
rali? may' draw Ar'guments, pro
vided he do it with due Cautions,
of which I ?hall ?peak under the
fourth We?ion. 2.*That the In
animate Bodies here below, that
r . Pffl
(77)
proceed not from Seminal Princi
ples, have but a more parable Tex
ture, (if I may ?o ?peak) as Earths,
Liquors,.Flints, Pebbles, and will
not ea?ily warrant Ratiocinations,
drawn from their ?uppo?ed Ends.
3. I think, the C'oele?ial Bodies
do abundantly declare God's Power
and Grea?itne?s, by the lmmen?ity
of their Bulk, and (if the Earth
?and ?ill) the Celerity of their
Motions, and al?o argue his Will
dom and general Providence as to
them; becau?e He has for lo many
\Ages, kept ?o many va? Vartz'cer,
or other Ma??es of Matter, in ?carce
conceivably rapid Motions , with
out de?roying one another, or
loo?ing their Regularity. And I
'?ee no Ab?urdity in ?uppo?ing, that,
amongothezr u?es of the Sun, and
of the Stars, the Service of Man
might bev intended ; .but yet I
doubt, whether, from the bare
Contemplation of the Heavens and
their Motions, it may be cogently
inferr'd, at lea? ?o ?rongly as Fi
nal
(78) l
nal Cau?es, may be from; the ?ru-?i
cture of Animals, that either the
?ole, or the chief, End of ' them all;
is to enlighten the Earth , and
bring Benefits to the creatures than
live upon it. -
In what has been hitherto laid
on our Second Qm?ion, 'tis plain;
that I ?uppo?e the Naturali? to di?m
cour?e meerly upon. Phy?ical
Grounds. But if the Revelations,
contain'd in the Hot)- Son'ptures, be'
admitted, we may rationally be
lieve More, and ?peak le?s Hae?ia
' t'antly, of the Ends of God, than
bare Philo?ophy will warrant us to'
do. For, if God is plea?ed to de
clare to us any thing concerning
His Intentions, in the making of
his Creatures, we ought to believe
it; tho' the con?ideration of the
things them?elves, did notgive us
, the lea? ?u?picion of it; which yet
in our ca?: they do. And therefore
a late Ingenious Author did caull
le?sly reflect upon me, for having
menj
(79 >
mention'd the En-ligh'tning of the
Earth, and' the Service'r'o? Men,
among th'eEnds of God, which
'he thought undi?coverable by us.
For whether or no we can di?cover
them by meet Rea?on, as divers of
the Heath?ienl' Philo?ophers thought
they did; yet ?ure. we mayv knowi
Tho?e 'that God is pleas'd to Reveal
to us: And the Peribns, I argu'd
with, were apparently ?uch as ad
mitted the Authority of the Scrip- _

us, that God made the two (Sena-16

(83)
dible, if they con?ider Man, as he
chiefly con?i?s ofa Rational Mind 5
which proceeds immediately from
God , and is capable of knowing
him, loving him, and being Eternal
ly happy with him. They that de?l
pi?e Man con?ider'd in this ca pacity,
do very little know the worth of a
Rational Soul; and e?imate things
like Ma?ons, and not like Jewellers,
who ju?ly value a Diamond no big
ger than a Bean,more than a whole
Watry of ordinary Stones. And -
particularly to tho?e undervaluers
oftheirown Species thatare Divines ;
it may be repre?ented,that God,who
will not be deny'd to be the be?
Judge in this ca?ie, asin all others ,
was pleas'd to con?iderMen ?o m uch,
as to give David cau?e to admire it

G 2 compa
(84)
'comparably more excellent than the

ble that God ?hould have intended,
that many of his other works ?hould
- be ?erviceable to Man; ?inceby
Miraculous Operations he hath ?ome
times Su?pended the Laws of Na

appear by No'abt Flood ; by the pall

nace,on Daniel: three Companions ;
and (to be ?hort) bjthe ?upendious
Eccliplc ofthe Sun at the full Moon,

But,
(89)
But, to con?ider the Difficulty it
?elf, there are two Accounts, on
which the Actions of natural A
gents may be laid to tend to a cer
tain End: One, when the Agent
has a Knowledge of that End, and
acts with an Intention to obtain it ;
as, when a man ?hoots an Arrow
to hitamark: The Otheris, when
the Action of the Proximate A
gent, is indeed ?o directed as it
ought to be to obtain an End, and
yetthat End is neither Known nor
Intended by the Proximate Agent,
but by a Remoter Agent that is In*
telligent; In the former of the?e
Sen?es, Icannot admit that (not
now to Examine whether any 'Liv- \
ing,but not Rational ,Works of Na
ture May) any Inanimate Bodies
Can, act for an End; for, to do ?o,
pre?uppo?es, that the Agent'both
Knows the End he is to attain, and
Purpo?es to attain it; which are
things whereof Inanimate Bodies
are uncapable. And to fancy" with
M - - ?ome
(9o)
?ome, that they may have a Know
ledge ?uz' generz's ( as they ?peak, )
which, tho'confin'd to the actions
proper to this or that particular
kind of Body, is yet ?ufficient to de

It remains then, that I embrace
the flzcond Sen?e, in which we for
merly ?aid,that Natural things may
be ?aid to to work for an End 3 tho'
indeed in this Ca?e, we mu? ?peak
?omewhat improperly : For,by him
that Con?iders, the Action will be
oftentimes more ju?ly attributed

plain'd. To me it ?eems, it-may
be thus conceiv'd : The mo? Wife
and Powerful Author of Nature,
who?e peircing fight is able to pene
trate the whole Univer?e, Sz ?urvey
all the parts of it at once, did at the
Beginning OF ThingszFrame things
Corporeal into ?uch a Sy?em, and
Settled among them ?uch Laws of
Motion, as he judg'd ?utable to the
Ends he propos'd to Himlelfiin ma
king the World. And as by vertue
of his va? and boundle?s IntelleEI:
that he at fir? imploy'd,he was able
not only to See the Pre?ent State
of things he had made, but to Fore
lee all the Effects, that particular
Bodies ?o and ?o qualify'd , and
acting according to the Laws of
Motion by him e?abli?h'd, could
in ?uch and ?uch circum?ances,have
on one another: So by the ?ame
Omni?cIent Power, he was able to
contrive the whole Fabrick, and all
the parts of it, in?uch manner,that,
whil? his general Concour?e main
tain'd the Qrder of Nature, each
part
(92)
Part of this great Engine,the World'
?hould without either Intention or
Knowledge, as regularly and con-.
?antly Act towards the attainment
of the re?pective Ends which he de-.
?ign'd them for , as if them?elves
really under?ood, and indu?riou?iy
pro?ecuted, tho?e Ends. Ju? as in
a well made Clock, the Spring, the
Wheels, the Ballance, and the other
?hparts, tbo' each of them Act accor
ding to the Impul?es it - receives,
and the Determination that is given
it, by the other pieces of the En
'gine', without knowing what the
Neighbouring Parts,or what thems
?e'lvesd'o ;' jet their Tendencies are
?o Determin'd,?ia'nd ?ometimes Over
rul*d,and theirMorions ?o Q'gickn'd,
by the ?ructure of the Clock, that
they would not ?imove more conve
niently ,?i nor better perform the
Functions of a Clock, if'they lenew??
that they were to make ?ithe' Index
truly mark the Hours , and intended
to make it do ?o. 'Tis true, that
'tis not ' ea?ie to conceive'how One
a
(93)
Agent ?hould, by ?o ?implean In;
?rument as Loralmotion, be able to
Direct abMultitude of Agents, as nu
merous as the Bodies that make up
a World, to Act as regularly,as if
each of them Acted upon its own
particular De?ign, and yet. all of
V,
them Con?pir'd to obey the Laws of '
Nature. But if we con?ider, that
'tis to God, that is an Omni?cient
and Almighty Agent,-that thisGreat
Work is a?crib'd, we ?hall not think
it incredible ; e?pecially'if we con.
?ider, that, whereas 'tis manife?
enough, 'that a Multitude of Bo
dies Act,as we have ?uppos'd ; if we
will not a?cribe the Direction and
Superintendence of the Motions,
that are manife?ly fitted. for the
attainment of Ends,unto God , we
mu? do it to Nature;which will not
Le??en but Increa?e the Difficulty:
And when I have ?een,*as ?ometimes
Ihave with plea?ure, a great En?i
gine, wherein the Works of I know
not how many Trades, and a great
many other Motions, were perform
ed
A,
(94)

the Tools of the Artifficers ; and all
the?e were ?et a work by oneSpring,
which communicated Motions that
were regulated and determined by
the particular ?ructure o? the little
Statues and other Bodies: when, I
fly, I con?ider ?uch things as the?e,
I cannot think it impo??i
Heb-n- 10- ble that the Divine and
, Great Anw??r??has bothPhi
lo?ophers and fircred Writers have
flyl'd the Worlds Creator ; ?hould
be able by the Motions and Struc
tures of Matter, to ?et a work very
many Partial and Subordinate En
gines. For 'twill not,I hope, be de
ny'd, that the Multitude of The?e
does not any thing near lb much fur,
pa?s the number of Tho?e, whichI
?aw in the hand of an illiterate
Trade?man, as the Narrow Know
ledge of that Artifficer is ?urpa?s'd
by the BoundlelS under?anding of
an Omni?cientArti?. And 'tis more,

and have a ?ufficient connection,
'tis not difficult to Direct a few of
them to the attainment of an End

the Jewi?h Husband-men, ( and at
the Ox, that intended no ?uch mat

well Separate the Grain from the
Straw, as our Plowmen do, when
they thre?h it purpo?ely to make

viceable to him, look upon Things
rather as Snrveyerr, who con?ider
mainly their Extent, than as Philo
fophers, that E?imate them by their
Intrin?ick Value. For tho' it be true,
that Man con?ider'dbarely asan Ani
nznl,is a Creature little enough to be
Contemptible; yet as He is endow'd
, with a Son! Immateria'l, Rational,
* and Immortal, he is a 'creature much
more Noble and Excellent than the
whole Terraqueous Globe , or a
much va?er Ma??e of Corporeal
Sub?ance that is Stupid and Inani

of under?anding and Willing',
(which are higher Faculties than'
meer ZVlnHer can reach to) and
which is more,of Knowing, Serving

the'only Vi?ible creature, that is

which is, That many parts of the

Material World, whereof Man has
not been known to make any ad

Am'mahmay yet be highly u?eful to
him, as he is a Rational Creature,

may be ?afely reckon'd among tho?h
Ends or u?es, which in the fir? Sec
tion we have Styl'd Human One: ;

on ?o Controverted a Science, 'tis

( 99) , _
from the otherz'yet all of them
to know by any of them, what
Hour 'tis of the, Night: And 'tis
ctmore known, that Fi?hermen and
Pilots didgener'lly for many Ages, *
till withinthe?e?our la? Centuries,
make very great u?e of the Pole- ?i
Star, and other of the Northern
fixt Ones, to guide them, when
nothing el?e couid, in the perilous
Cour?es of their Navigations.
I have ?een, and bee??n Ma?er of
a Tele?cope, made in the form of
'a Walking-Staff, ?o that it was fit- ?i
ted 'to lerve for ?everal purpoles;
whereof tho' one was very different
were in the Idea of the Artificer,
and intendedct by him. The like I'
may be ?aid of a Concave Metalline
Burning-Gla?s; which, tho' it is
imploy'd 20 magnify the Pictures!
of Objects, to ca? their Images in
to the Air, and to Concen'ter the
Sun-beams to a Fomr,in which they
will burn ?everal Bodies; jet The?e
and many other things, which, thoz
:hey ?eem to have little AffinltY
I 2' with
( too)
with the?e, are perform'd by a
Metalline Concave, were before
hand de?in'ated by the Arti?, who
fore?aw and intended, that in ?uch
variousjunctures of Circum?ances,
it ?hould produce all tho?e deter
minate Effects.
And indeed, if we con?ider Gods
Omni?cience and Providence, and
how Indulgent aCreator he has been
to Man ', it. may well ?eem rea?on
able to think, that m God fore?aw
that Men might make very various
and profitable u?es of divers of his
other Creatures, by the help of
that Prerogative of Rea?on, which
he had vouch?af'd them; So he de
?ign'd that Men ?hould reap the Ad
Vantages he had made many of his
other Works capable 'of affording
them. And Iconfe?s, l think this
Reflection may juffl'y ?erve to Re
commend the Doctrine about Final
Cau?es that we embrace, to Philo->
?ophers that are truly pious : Since
it furni?hes them with ju? Argu
ments
<m>
ments forGratitude to the Author'
of ?o many good things, as the
Corporeal World, by being con
templated or po??e?, affords them.
For to look upon the World , as
va? and curious a Work as it is,on
ly as a va? and curious piece of
Workman?hip; may indeed give
'a Man a great Idea of the Power
and Skill of the Divine Architect :
But will rather exact his Wonder,
than his Gratitude. And there
fore the Ancient Ari?otelians, who
look'd upon the World as Eternal
and self-exi?ent in a Condition
like its pre?ent Sy?em; did not
u'?h to Thank God for the Benefits
they receiv'd from things Corpo\
real: Tho' ?ome of them thought
them?elves Oblig'd to thank Na
ture; which they look'd upon as
acting with De?ign, and propo
?ing to her Self for Ends, the Wel
fare of the Univer?e, and of Men.
To illu?rate this with ?omething,
who?e Application is Obvious. If

not 'imitate Their Boldne?s, that
not only affirm, that the Saw and

Cele?ial Bodys, .were made ?olely
forthe u?e of Man; but Pre?ume

a Sy?em of the World to be True,

the Pormer is, as they think, better
fitted to the Conveniency of Man
kind,or the other le?s ?uited to that
'End , or perhaps altogether U?e
le?s or unnece??ary to it: As,
when they Argue, that the Sun

They fancy,'tis more convenient for
Man, that tho?e Di?ant Bodys, than
that the Earth, which is His Habi*
tation, ?hould be kept in Motion.
But, con?idering things as meer Na

that a mo? Wi?e Agent ?hould
have Made ?uch va? Bodys, as the
Sun and the fixt Stars, e?pecially if

?aid, I?hall not quarrel with the

I know 'tis object-1
ed by the Epitnre-t,

Animals were fir?
made, and their U
?es afterwards found
out by mens Sagaci
ty. But this isa Sou
phi?ical Objection.
For,_fir?, as to many.
of the Inner parts,as,
the Heart, Liver ,
Spleen, Kidneys, We;
e They?i
(\5I)
They perform their Functions
without ?o much as Our Knowledge
of their Structure, or perhaps their
Situation ; ?o far are they lrorn be
ing applyed to ?uch u?es by Our Sa
gacity. And as for the Limbs and
other Parts, which we can Move at
plea?ure; 'tis true, that they cannot
be actually Imployed to the re?pec
tive u?es , till they be actually
Form'd 3 but That hinders not but
that in their Formation they were
therefore ?oFormed, that they may
be in due time fit for ?uch u?es.
And therefore we ?ee,that the Chick
is furni?hed with compleat Eyes,
and with Wings and Feathers, be
fore he be Hatch'd zjtho' whil? he
is yet inclos'd in the Egg, he can
not make u?e of them to See or
Flye. And why V as it, do the Epi
mream' think, that Nature provid
ed a whole Set or 'l?iempormj Parts
for Pregnant Pemales,and Animals
in the Womb, which, when they
are come into a freer'?ate, partly
fall away ofthemfelves, and partly
L 4 turn
'(1z2)
turn to a Ligament,fitted no longer
for the former, but for a more ?ea
?onable u?e P And 'tis to be noted,
that the Production o? the?e Umbi
lical Ve??els, and the Placenta or A
nalogous Body in the Womb to
which they are fa?ten'd, is of no
Nece??it nor u?i: to the Female be
fore Conception; and thereby tho?e
Temporary Parts appear to have bin
' Defign'd by Nature,not ?o much for
the Per?onal Pre?ervation of the Fe
male as for thePropagation of theSpe
an; Which De?ination not coming
to be accompli?hed, till a Woman,
for inflance,has attain'd to a compe
tent Age, appears to have been pre
ordain'd by the Author of Man
kind for the Continuation of It.
And tho' it be true,that the Sagaci
ty of men may have found out ?ome
u?es of ?ome Parts of their Bodys,
that cannot be made appear to have
been Primarily Inten ded by the Au
thor of Nature ; yet That is no good
Argument, that tho?e u?es were not
intended, which either are made
With
(153 )
Within us, or do, as it were obtrude
them?elves Upon Us. And as for
other u?es,the Pre?eience and Good
ne?s of God are ?uch, that it ought
not to appear incredible, That He
that gave man both the Limbs of
his Body, and the Rational Endow
ments of his Mind, and that has
made many Parts, as the Eyes and
the Ears, Double, that One may
?upply the Want of the Other ; Did
both Fore?ee what U?es men might,
according to their Sagacitys and E
mergencies, >make of the?e Parts,
and ?o Contrive the Parts that they
?hould be applicable to ?uch U?izs.
Suppo?e, a Wi?e man ?hould ?end
his Son to Travel, and among other:
things give him a Pocket-Dyal with
a Magnetic Needle ; and this Tra
veller having lo? his way in ?ome
wild Plain, or being at Sea in a Ve?
?el, who?e Compa?s was broken or

Mi?chance : If, I?ay,irz this ca?e tho'
the Traveller Ordinarily Imployed
his Dyal only to find the Hour of the
Day,

Day, He ?hall now Imploy it to
Guide his Cour?e, or Steer the Ve?l
?el, by the helpof the Needles point
ing Northward; tho' this would
be an Effect of His own Sagacity ,
yet his Father being a Wiie and
Experienced Man, may rea?ona bly

of knowing the Northern and Sou

and a Pallet furni?h' dwith Colours,
to 'draw a Particular tPro?pect, ctis
not to be ?uppos'd to have De?ign'd,
that he ?hould not Imploy them to
any other purpo?e, if Urgent Cir- '
cum?ances made it requi?ite for him
to do io. v
Having in?i?ed longer than I in
tended upon the former part of my
And *
Propo-v
lists)
Propo?ition, I now proceed to the
latter; namely, That in ?ome ca?es
we may from the known Ends of
Nature, as well as from the Struct
ure of the Parts, ground Probable
Conjectures, both Affirmative and
Negative, about the particular Offi
ces of the Parts; Which I could
not ?ea?onably doe before, becau?e
the Arguments, that were founded
on the u?es of the Parts of Animals,
?uppo?e, not only that tho?e Parts
were de?inated to Particular u?es
knowable by us, but that the leve
ral Parts of the Body were Contri
ved as Wi?iely and commodiou?ly as
Men are able to Devi?e, in order to
the Ends of Nature; which is always
to be under?ood to have united
in her De?igns,the u?es of theParts,
and the Welfare of the Whole.
- And indeed if we con?ider, how
admirable a Fitne?s there is in the
Parts of the Human Body, for in
?ance, to tho?e Particular Ends we
can-di?cover them to have been Pre
?? ?i de?ign'd
{./

\
(1z6)
_ n'am-t
de?ign'd for ,* it ?eems allowable to
Conjecture, that ?uch a Part was
not Primarily Defign'd to ?uch an
U?e, becau?e it is, on the account
of its Structure or otherwi?e, le?s
Fitted for it,than the con?ant Wi?
dom of Nature ?eems to require;
Parts, by which That Office may
be more commodiou?ly perform'd.
And on the other ?ide, it may be a
Probable Ground, tho' not altoge
ther ?o Probable as the former, to
Conclude that ?uch a Part was De
?inated to ?uch an u?e, ifthe u?e
it ?elf appear to be nece??ary,and
the Part better fitted for it than any
Other is.
Thus, tho' Anatomical and Opti*
cal Writers, as well as the Schools,
did for many ages unanimou?iy con
the Principal Seat of Vi?ion; yet
theindu?ri0usScheiner,in his u?eful
Tract intituled ocular, does ju?ly
enough 'reject that receiv'd Opiniobn,
Y
e?pecially if there' be any Other _.
clude, the cry?alhhe Humor to be,
(Is7)
by ?hewing, that it Suits not with
the Skill and Providence of Nature,
to make that Part the Seat (or
chief Organ) of Vi?ion, for which
it wants divers requi?ite Aralifica
tions, e?pecially mo? of the?e being
to be ?ound in the Retina. And
I remember that when I asked our
famous Harvey, in the only Di?l
cour?e I had with him, (which was
but a while be fore he dyed ) What
were the things that induc'd him to
think of a Circulation of the Blood ?
He an?wer'd me, that when he took
notice that the Valves in the Veins
of ?o many ?everal Parts of the Bo
dy, were ?o Plac'd that they gave
free pa??age to the Blood Towards
the Heart, but oppos'd the pa??age
of the Venal Blood the Contrary
way: He was invited to imagine,
that ?o Provident a Cau?e as Nature
had not ?o Plac'd ?o many Valves
without De?ign : and no De?ign
?iiem'd more probable, than That,
?ince the Blood could not well, be
cau?e of the interpo?ing Valves, be
Sent by the Veins to the Limbs; it
?hould
( I z 8 )
?hould beSe'nt through the' Arteries,v
andReturn through the Veins,who?e
Valves did not oppo?e, its cour?e
that way.
Thus, whereas former Anatom
mi?s and Phy?icians generally be
lieved the Nutrition of the Parts by
t-he Venal Blood, the more Recent
Writers are wont to teach, that the
Parts are nouri?h'd by the Blood in
its pa??age through the Arteries.
Not that they Think,the Blood that
runs through the Veins altogether
un?it to Irrig'ate the Parts with that .
Vital Liquor *; but that they Judge
the Veins to be le?s fit than the Ar
teries, into which the Blood comes
immediately from the left Ventricle
of the Heart, Agitated and SPlI'itlÞ-?i =
ous,and with a brisk Impul?e,which
forces out the Particles of the Blaod,
at tho?e Poresof theArterz'esthat they
find Congruous to their Shape and
Size, and which an?wer to the Fe
veral Parts that are to be nouri?hed
by Corpu?cles ?o Wali?ied. 'T wenroet ii
( 1 59 )
not Difficult,if 'twere Nece??ary,to
accumulate In?ances to the ?ame
purpofizs with tho?e already menti
oned; there being nothing more fre
quent in the Books of Anatomi?s,
and tho?e that treat of the Phy?ioo
logical and Pathological parts of
Phy?ick, than to draw Arguments,
as well Affirmative as Negative, a.
bout the ure of the Parts of the Bo
dy, from their Fitne?s or un?itne?s,
or their greater or le??er Fitne?s, to
attain ?uch Ends asare ?uppos'd to
have been De?ign'd by Nature. And

in the fir? Section of it, and others

pothefis, which A?cribes the Origine
of' Things to Chtmce , and Rejects
the Intere? of a Dez'ty, and the De
?ignin of Ends, in the Production
and anagement of Natural things.
But becau?e I ob?erve, not without
grief, that of late years too many
other-1
( 16 r )

have with the Innocent Opinions
of Epimms, embrac'd tho?eIrreligi
ous ones, wherein( as I was ?ay
ing) the Deity and Providence are
quite Excluded ?romhaving any In
fluence upon the Motions of Matter,
all who?e Productions are refer'd to
the Ca?ual Concour?e of Atoms:
For this Rea?on, I ?ay, I thought
it a part of my Duty, as wellto the
mo? Wi?e Author of Things, as to
Their Excellent Contrivance, and
Vlutual Sub?erviency, to ?ay Some
thing, tho' but briefly, yet di?inct
y and exprelly , to ?hew , That,
t lea? in the Structure and Na
ure o? Animals, there are Things
hat argue a far Higher and Nobler
'rinciple, thanzis Blind C/mme. But,
hat Imay do what I here intend,
lith as much brevity asI can,I will
o little more than name ?hme Par
culars, that I have not ob?erved to
e ?o u?ually reflected on, to the
urpo?e for which Imention them.
nd I ?hall Confirm the?e Con?ide
M rations
eaa<.wr_-a-ffl4y-"_:w3;"4---'m*-->*--z
(162)
rations but with One In?ance, and
That too, taken from a Sort of Parts
that are as little Elaborate, and
therefore ?eem to be as little Fit for
my Pu'rpo?iz, as almo? any in the,
Humane Body.
I will not now inculcate what
has been delivered, and may be
farther ?aid , of that Exqui?ite
Strufture of the Bodies of Dead A-v
nimals, that is di?coverable by the
Knives of Anatomi?s ; (tho' I ?hall'
not Scrupuloufly forbear to touch
lightly on a few things of that kind,
that are requi?ite to my Purpo?e : )
My pre?ent De?ign being, to ?et
down very briefly a few Arguq
ments, to strengthen the Propofi
tion lately delivered.
Fir? then , I ob?erve, That
there ?eems to have'been Care ta
ken, that the Body of an Animal
?hould be furni?hed, riot only with
all things that are Ordinarily Ne
ce??ary and Convenient, but with
' ?ome
l,
( 163 )
?ome Superabundant Provi?ion for
Ca?ualties. Thus, t/a?ia' aMan may
Live very well, and Propagate'his
Kind, (as many do,) tho'he have
but One Eye 5 yet Nature is wont
to furni?h Men with Two Eyes,
that, if One be De?royed or
Di?ea?ed, the Other may ?uffice for
Vi?ion. And ?o, if One Ear grow
Deaf, a Man may be Conver?ied
with, by the help ofthe Other that
remains Sound. In ?hort, Nature -
has furni?hed Men with Double
Parts of the fiime Kind, Where that
Duplicity may be highly u?eful',
and can be permitted without In
v congruity to the re? of the Body.
And this is the more Con?iderable,
becau?e in Other Parts Nature ap
pears to Husband things, ?o, as to
Shun doing things' Superfluous :
As Within the Skull, ?ome Ve??els r
that would in other Parts of the Bo
dy have Double Coats like other
Arteries, are much Thinner, almo?
like Veins; the Thicknefs of the
Skull being ordinarily a ?ufficient
M 2 - Fence
'(I64)
Fence to them from External Inju
ries.
Another Argument, That di- -
vers Things that Nature does about
Animals , are done with De?ign,
may be taken from what Anato
mi?s Ob?erve of Tho?e Parts of the - i

as ?oon as he cornes abroad into the

ticularly the Two Arteries and the

they are wrapt up in, and Tho?e
(commonly call'd the Chorz'orz and
the t?mfliflfi) that Involve the Fw

and when Ithas quitted the Womb,
are Expell'd after it,whence they are
call'd the Afler-hirth ; there remain

the Liver, where its U?e is Con?i

more to convey Blood, or an Ali

To the ?ame Purpo?e with this
Contrivance, we may mention that
other, wherein Nature employs the

to the Blood from the Right Ven<

the Circulation of It may be main*

the Pulmonick Ve??els, according
to the Primary Intention of Nature.

particularly in this Place.
The Untaught Skill ofSpiders, in
Weaving their Curious Webs,that
are ib Fitly Contrived , both to
Catch their Flying Prey, and give
them immediate Notice of its being
Caught, is a Thing, which, if it
were not Familiar, would be look'd
upon as Admirable. And this Skill -
is not, as Some Imagine, an Effect
of imitation of their Parents : For '
if the Eggs be taken away and en
?i clos'd
(172),
clos'd ina Gla?s, when they come
to be Hatch'd by the Heat of the
Sun, the little Creature will Imrne
diately fall to Spinning in the Gla?s
it?elf, as was related to me, by an
Eminent Mathematician that made
the Experiment. And I ?aw the
\ le?s rea?on to Di?ru? it, becau?e,
having by an External Heat Hatch'd
many Eggs of Silk-worms, in a
of a long time before, nor probably
ever till then, yet the Worms ro
j-'Vg uc'd by the?e Eggs,did in AutumLri?i,
o t eir own accord, Climb up to
tho?e convenient Places I had pre
par'd for Them, and there Weave
tho?e Curious Oval Pri?ons in which
they enclo?ie them?elves, and which
are Unrevel'd into Silk, of who?e
extreme Finene?s or Slenderne?s I
have el?ewhere given an Account."
Nor is the provident Indu?ry of
Animals confin'd to Iniec'ts, of
whom the Poet, (if his words be
taken

Since 'tis to be found in divers_of
the Greater Animals, particularly
in Beavers ,- of whom tho' Some
things that are recounted by Au

lous ; jet what has been related to
me by. Sober and Judicious Perlbns,
that were either Born or Liv'd in*
New Engldnd, where the?e Animals
abounding, they had the Opportu
nity to ob?erve Them; is ?ufficient
to Confirm ?uch Relations, as may
give One ju? Cau?e of Wonder.
For the?e Credible Per?ons affirm'd,
That the Beavers withtheir ?harp

', Winter-hou?es, in which there is _
?ometimes a kind of Second story, -
for the Inhabitants to retire to ,

chu?e a very Convenient Situation, ;

Fi?h: And, That the Overture or
Hole that belongs to each of the?e
Hou?es, is plac'd ju? by the Wa<

Flounce into It, and ?o Save them
?elves when their Houles are At
taqu'd. And to Facilitate their'
Swimming away, and the Catch
ing of their Prey in the Waters,
Nature has furni?h'd them, as I
have Ob?ierv'd with plea?ure in a
Live Beaver, with two Feet not
made like Tho?e of Dogs, or Cats,
or like their Own two Other Feet,
but furni?h'd with broad Mem
branes betwixt the Toes, like the
Feet of Gee?h, Ducks, and other A
quatick Animals, that are to u?e
them as Oars, to Thru? away the

_ 'Twere ea?ie to accumulate In
?ances of the Sagacity and Indu
?ry of Animals, for their own Pre
fere/aim: But 'tis more ea?ie to
find Notable Ones, among tho?e
Aflions that concern the Propaga
tion of their Species. '
The various Arts employ'd by
Animals of differing Kinds about
the Materials , the Con?ruction,
and the Situation of their Ne?s,
is u?ually Remarkable, and ?ome
times Wonderful. Of this Skill,
we have divers Eminent In?ances,
?ome of which Ihave been delight
ed to See, but have not time to
Recount. Yet One there is, who?e
Oddne?s will not ?uffer me to pre-_
termit it. For in a Country that
abounds with Apes and Mon
keys, that are very Greedy of Birds
Eggs, and oftentimes Climb Trees
to come at Them ; there is a Son;
. o
(I76)
of Birds, who?e Eggs they pecu?i
liarly affect, that do as it were Hang
their Ne?s at or near the end of
?ome long Flexible Branchor Wand,
that grows Over the Water; by
which means their In?idious Ene
mies, who do not Swim, cannot'
come at them underneath ; and by
rea?on of the Yielding of the Flexi
gble Branch or Twigs whereto the
Ne? is fa?ened, they are Frighted
from venturing to pa?s on, for want
of a Firm Support. .
rThe Structure of the Ne?s of
Wa?ps, which they often make un- r
der Ground to Secure them, Ihave
ob?erv'd to be very Curious and
Artificial, e?pecially when the
Young Ones are Form'd in the
little Cells, where they lye Hid and
'Shelter'd till they are readysto Fly
away.
Irnight here multiply Examples
of this Kind, but I think it fitter to
proceed, by telling you, That the
, In?incts
( 177 ) -
' modious Materials to Build with.
?n?incts that Nature has Implanted
in Animals to pre?erve them?elves,
tho' they would ?eem Admirableif
they were le?s Familiar, are much
Inferiour to That Providence that
She has furni?h'd Animals with, for
the Propagation of their Species.
. There are diver?e Notable Things
to be met with in the Ne?s of ?everal
Birds, both as to their Materials,
their Structure, and the very Situa
tions of the Places pitch'd upon to
Build them in. I have ?een ?ome
Ne?s,e?pecially Indian Ones,which
would make a Man Wonder, how
the Birds that Built them, ?hould
?eek and find ?uch Odd, and yet,
all Circum?ances con?ider'd, Com
Of which we have an Eminent ln
?ancein the Ne?s of certain Ezz/Zem
Birds, who?e Names I remember
not, that make their Ne?s of a
White Sub?ance, (which has been
Pre?ented me by ?ome of our Ea/Z
India Merchants,) that looks almo?
' ' ' N like
( l7 8 )
't Let
like Ictbjocol/a, in the Shops com
monly call'd lflngld?t, and is Di??o
luble in Liquors, and ?o very well
Ta?ed, that it makes the chief
Sawce that they u?e in the southern
Parts of India at their Fea?s, The
Structure al?o of the Ne?s of di
vers Birds, both as to their Figure,
heir Capacity ?uitable to the Bulk
of the Builders, and the Accommo
dations they are fu??rni?h'd with for
Warmth and Softne?s, may de?erve
to be Applauded by Ma'thematicians
them?elves :. e?pecially if it be con
?ider'd, that the?e little Untaught
Architects had no Tools to make
their Curious Buildings with, ?ave
their Beaks and their Feet. And
yet much more of Providence and
Pore?ight appears in the Situation
of the Places, that ?ome Birds make
Choice of to Build their Ne?s in:
As may be ob?erv'd, not only in
the Pendulous Ne?s of Swallows,
and the Crafty Hidden Ones Of
?ome Ettro etm Birds, but very
con?picuoully in the Hanging and
' Movea-ble
(I79>
He'maaMyMna'eÞ-n.'!
Moveable Ne?s, that we lately men
tion'd to be lo Oddly plac'd by lbme
Birds, to ?ecure their Eggs from
,-Apes and Monkeys; and by
the
Situation of the well Ta?ed Ne?s
I_ was newly ?peaking of, which
are to be found only upon high and
?eep Rocks , and are ?o fa?ned
to tho?e Concave Parts of them that
look downwards, and, for the mo?
part, hang directly over the Sea ,
that there is no getting Them with
out much Trouble and Danger, by
the help of Boats and Poles : Upon
. which Account, as well as That of
their Deliciou?ne?s, they are veryv
'Dear in the Edfi Imlz'er them?elves.
The like Care to Contrive their
Ne?sAdvantageoufly, and make
. them in Secure Places, is taken by
divers infects them?elves, as may
be ob?erv'd in the Subterraneal
Ne?s of the Wa?ps formerly men
tioned, and in the Eggs of Snails,
which I have ?ometimes found Hid
under Ground, and had the Curio
?ity to Hatch in Gla??es furni?h'd
N2 with
\\
_ ( t 80 )
with the ?ame Earth they were
found in.
If I?hould here reckon up and
di?play the ?everal Effects, and con
?equently Arguments, of the Won
derful Providence, that the mo?
'i?e Author of Nature exerci?es
about the Propagation of Animals,
by di?ingui?hing them into Male
and Female: By furni?hing both
Sexes with Mutual Appetites and
Organs, exqui?itely adapted to the
Increale of their Kind: By the ad
mirableFormation of the Fwtm in
the Womb, without the Females
Knowledge How it is perform'd :
By the ?range Subtilties and Cou
rage'that Several of them, either
Oviparous or Viviparous, have, to
Hide and Defend their Young: By
the full Provi?ion that is made for
the Nouri?hment of the Fat-tus, and
the Welfare of the Female after She
has brought It forth : And by di
vers other Ways thatI mu? not
now fla to ?pecifie. If I?ay l
y , ?hohld
?hould ventur(e 1t8o 1do this, I might
indeed, much enrich and adorn my
Argument, but ?hould make this
' Di?cour?e too much exceed the Li
mits that my De?ign, and ?mall
Stock either of Ability or Lei?ure,
would allow. And therefore, in
?ead ofpur?uing a Speculation, that
would lead me a great deal too far,
I ?hall look back upon the Intima?i
tion I gave not long fince, that even
tho?e Meaner Parts of Animals
which ?eem to have been Fram'd
with the lea? Care or Contrivance,
are yet not unworthy of their Au
thor. >
For Proo? of which, I?hall now
ob?erve , That tho' the Teeth be
* ?ome of the lea? Elaborate Parts of
the Humane Body ; jet even The?e
afford more Ob?ervations appliable
to our pre?ent Purpo?e, than my I'n
tended Btevity will permit meto
take Notice of. And therefore I
?hall only, and that little more than
tranfiently, con?ider a few of Them
M 3 here ;

here ; and ?ome of the Others el?e
where, on tho?e particular Occa?i
ons, on' which it will be more Pro
per to bring them in.
I. And Fir?, 'Tis con?iderable,
That whereas, when a Man is come
to his full Statute, all the Other
Bones of the Body cea?e to Grow,
the Teeth , continue to Grow in
Length, during a Man's whole Life.
This Growth of the'Teeth ap*
pears, not only by their Continuing
?o many Years of the Same Length,
but by the Lln?rghtly Length of One
Tooth, when That which was. op
po?ite to It in the other Jaw hap
pening to Fall out or be Pulld out,
the Tooth we ?peak of has liberty, ,
to Grow into the Gap madeby the
Removal of the Other. Of this Dif
ference in point of Growth betwixt
the Teeth and other Bones, What
Rea?on can be ?o probably given, as,
That 'tis de?ign'd to repair the
Wa?e that is daily made of the

the Body (lbme few Small Ones

thin and ?en?ible Membrane, which,
for its clofi: adhe?ion to the Bone, is
by Anatomi?scall'd the Perio?eum :
That Part?iof each 'Tooth which is
not cover'd by the Gums, has none
of this Membrane, which would be
?ubject to frequent and. very pain

A _ III. To enable the Teeth toBreak,
and make Comminutions of. the
more Solid kind of Aliments, Na
ture has providently Fram'd them
of a Cloler and Harder Sub?ance,
than almo? any other Bones of the

above Three Hundred of them.
And I have met with Relations in

The?e little Ve??els that reach to It;

V. In regard that Babes are, ac
cording to Nature's In?itution, to
feed for acon?iderable time on Milk,
for which there is no need of Teeth,
' - i and
(185)'
and which would al?i) Hurt the
Nipples of Her that gives them
Suck: Nature forbears for many'
Months to produce Teeth-in Hu-.
mane Infants : whereas the Fretm's
of divers Brute Animals, that are
oftentimes reduc'd Early to ?eek
out Aliments that are not Fluid, nor
very Soft, are Born with Teeth al
ready Fdrm'd in their Jaws.

ted for the Comminution of Ali

?ons, (which for Brevity's lake l
here omit,) to be in either Jaw
Entire , or all of one Piece: And
therefore Nature has providently
made for that u?e, a competent
Number of di?inct Bones in either
Jaw. And, becau?e Men may of
ten have Occa?ion, to feed upon
very differing' Sorts offflAliments,
and u?ually'the Same Aliment may
require Diffiering Preparations in

Rows orz-Sets-of Teeth, equal for
the mo? part in Number, ( each
Jaw in Men u?ually having Sixteen,"
andinWomen Fourteen or Fifteen)
and an?wering to each other, but;
yet of differing shapes, for differing
u?es. For Some, as the Fore-teeth,
are Broader; and with a zki?ld of
Edge, t_o Cut- the morez_Y-i_eldin

VII. Andbecaule theOperations
to be perform'd- by the Teeth, often,
xtimes require a con?iderable Firm
lne?s and Strength, Partly/aim the
lTeeth them?elves, and partly in the
iln?ruments that Move the Jaw
zwhierein the Lower Set of them is
zfix'd : Nature bm provided the
iLower Jaw, ( which alone is Mo

lCr0c0dz'Zer,) with Strong Mu?bles,to
make it bear, forcibly again? the
upper Jaw : And be: not only
Plac'd each Tooth in a di?inct Ca
vity of the Jaw-bone, as it were
in a Cl0?e,Strong,and Deep Socket,
but [m furni?h'd the ?everal Sorts of
Teeth with Hold-fa?s, ?uitable to
the'Stre?, that, by rea?on of their
Di?ering Offices, they are to be
put to. And therefore, whereas
the
(188)
the Other Teeth (the Cutters and
the Dog-teeth)have u?ually but One
Root, (which in the?e la? nam'd
is wont to be very Long 5) the
Grinders, that on many Occa?ions
are employed to Crack Nuts,Bones,
or Other'Hard Bodies, before they
can be Ground ', are furni?h'd with
Three Roots, and oftentimes with
Four, in the upper Jaw , who?e
Sub?ance is ?omewhat softer, and
who?e Grinders Serve as ?o many
little Anvils,for Tho?e of the Lower
to Strike or Pre?s. again?; On
which Account, as hath been alrea
dy lntimated, the Lower Jaw, (for
the Other belongs to the lmmoveaa

with a ?rong Mu?cle on either ?ide,"
capable of Moving It, and con?e-??

If ?ome Favourer'of Epimms's
Doctrine ?hall here. object, that,
tho' Man indeed be Advantagioufly
furni?h'd with Teeth, yet there are
many
(I39)
many Other Animals , and even
Wadrupeds, whereof ?ome have
not near ?o Many Teeth as Man,nor
?o Commodioufly shap'd and Plac'd
as His; and Others are not fur
ni?h'd with any Teeth at all : And
that likewi?e there are many Other
Animals, that have ?ome of their
Other Parts le?s Convenient in their
Kind, or otherwi?e are not near ?o
well provided for, as they would
be, if they were not rather Ca?ual
Productions, than tho?e of an Intel
ligent and De?igning Opificer: If
The?e things, I?ay, be Objected, I
mu? own my?elfofa very differing
vOpinion from the Objector. And
I think Icould add much about the
Fz'ml Cau?e: of Things Corporeal,
as the Con?ideration of them leads
to a high Veneration of their Divine
Author, and as it tends to manife?,
that, when His Providence is De
ny'd or Condemn'd, 'tis for want of
Its having been ?ufficiently undet
?ood, and duely Confider'd- But,
_ be?ides that this Third Propo?ition
ought
( 190)
ought to be but One Part of our Di

great Part prevented my?elf alrea

often be, That in this Ca?e it would'
be le?s proper for Other Ends, of
more Importance to the Welfare of

Our Sagacious Moderns are to this

tlttdihg, 7207 too Pofitz've in Afl'ertt'hg,
that This or That mu?t he, or is, the
particular De?zcthated U?e offitth at
Thing, or the Motz'tve that z'hdttc'd
the Author of Nature to Frame it
thus. '
T has been above declar'd, That
?ome Parts are ?o EXceIlently,
and ?o Manife?ly, Fitted for a cer
tain U?e, as the Eye for Seeing ;
and ?o much better Fitted for That;
than for any Other ; that 'twere
little le?s than Heedle?sne?s or Per
ver?ene?s, to Doubt of Its being
® ' De?i
(zr-s)
?idDe?inated Thereto. But the like
cannot be ?iaid of all the Other Parts
of the Body, e?pecially of the In-- A
ternal. And there are divers Llfizs,
either Nece??ary,or highly Condu
cive, to the Welfare of the Anis
mal, -to which no One Part is ?o
much more con?picuou?iy Pitted
than any Other, but that 'tis more
Difficult than many think, to de
termine the Trueand Primary U.
?ias or Offices of ?ome Parts, e?pe
cially with ?o much Certainty, as
thereon to ground Phy?iological
Inferences : And of this Difficulty
Iconceive there may be fom- Rea
?am, tho' they do not All, nor per
haps Mo? of them, occurr in Each
particular Ca?e.
And Fir?, the whole Animal it
?elf, the u?i: of who?e particular
'Parts is under inquiry, is but a Part
of that greater Body, the 'Died-ver?e,
and therefore cannot ea?ily be ?up
os'd, to have been frarn'd and fur
ni?h'd with the Parts it con?i?s of,
P 4. meerly
(2t6)
meerly for its own ?ake. And
when we ?ay,that all its Parts are
* \for the Animal,I conceive it is to be
under?ood in this Limited Sen?e ;
That the Parts are excellently,
fram'd for the Welfare of the Ani>
mal, as far forth as That Welfare
is con?i?ent with the General Ends
of the Airthor of Nature, in the
Con?itution and Government of
the Univer?e : which Ends,becau?e
they relate to the whole World, or
to very con?iderable Ma??es of it, as
the Terraqueous Globe, the Pla
nets, and other Stars,l have former
ly,for brevity's ?ake,?yl'd co?mical:
And tho' it has not been prov'd,
that None of the?e Co?mz'mj Ends
are inve?igable by us : yet to di?l
_ Task. And yet it ?eems pre?ump
tuous to?uppofe, that the Welfare
of particular Animals is any fur

cover them All, lS not an ea?ie ,
(2 117) '
Gods General Providence ,* to
which his Special or Particular\
Providence,about this or that meer
Animal, ought in rea?on to be Su
bordinated. And tho' I think it a
great Ra?hne?s for us men to De
termine po?itively, and exrla?ivel]
to other: , what Ends the Omni
?cient Creator propos'd to him?elf,
in giving to the World the Frame
we?eeit has; yet, as far as I can
\ hitherto di?cern, I ?ee nothing that
is more likely to have been One
Grand Motive of ?o great a Variety
as we may ob?erve in his Corpo
real Works, e?pecially in Animals,
than that which hath in part been
el?ewhere intimated, w'z. That He
mi ht, byl?o many and ?o very
differing Contrivances, as are to be
met Within the Structure of Men,
Four-footed Bea?s , Birds , Fi?hes,
Reptiles, m. Exerci?e and Di?
play (what couldnot be by a le?s
Villritlzlty ?o fully ;panife?ed) that
w ic an zfpa?/e, peak

the r7m7tu- mim7t©a ampler. 'rg Os; (the
M'tlttfdrioll? or Mahtfold dom of
God) Man being acknowledg'd,
upon the account of his very Body,
the mo? Perfect of Animals ; if
God had ?imply De?ign'd the giving
of every Animal, the mo? Advan
tageous Structure that could be de
vis'd, it ?eems that He ?hould have
Made no Other Animals than Men.
But then there could not have been
that Diver?ity of Contrivance a
mong Living Atttomhth, that does
?o much recommend the Wi?dom
of Him, that could Frame ?o Many
and ?o Differing Animals, tho' not'
All of them equally Per-fect, yet
All of them admirably Furni?h'd
for tho?e Purpo?es to which He De
Ptinated them. And therefore it
does not argue any Want of Provi
dence, that He has not Furni?h'd
Man with Wings, as he hath Birds;
nor Fi?hes with four Feet ; nor
Birds with Fins and Scales: be
cau?e the?e Parts would have been
either
(=l9)
either Superfluous and Burthen?om,
or would not have Suited with his '
De?ign, of making Some Animals
Live on the Earth, and Some in the
Water : And if He De?ign'd any
to Live, tho7 not equally, in Both,
He ?urni?h'd Them, with Parts of a
Peculiar Structure, as Ihave el?e
where noted of the Bed-ver and the
Frog. If it were not for the ?ore
mentioned con?ideration, 'twould
be hard to give a Rea?on, why Ve
getables were not made the Food of
all Animals ,- But Some ?hould be
Carnivorous, and furni?h'd with
Appetites and Organs to Devour
Others, and Live, as Birds and
Bea?s of Prey do, upon the De
?ruction of the Weaker. And
'twill be hard to ?hew, ,why, even
in Animals of the ?ame Kind, the
Safety of Some ?hould be ?o much
better Provided for than that of
Others; as We ?ee, that ?ome
Ants, and ?ome Glew-worms ,
are Furni?h'd with Wings; and
Some not. And in Mankind i i it?elf,
( no )
it?elf, Tho?e of the Female Sex are
not ?o happily Fram'd, in order'to
their own Welfare, as Tho?e of the
Ma?culine :, Since the Womb, and
other Things peculiar to Women,
which are not Nece??ary to the
Good of Individual Per?ons, but
to the Propagation of their Spe
\ cier, ?ubject that tender Sex to a
whole Set of Di?ea?es, belonging
to them either peculiarly, as they
are Women, or as they are with
Child, or brought to Bed; from
all which Men are exempt. So
that, to apply the?e Things to Our
pre?ent Purpo?e ; Men may ?ome
times Mi?ake, when they peremp
torily Conclude, that This or That
Part of an Animal Mu?, or Can
not, have been Fram'd for ?uch an
U?e, without con?idering the Ca?
miml, andtherefore Primary and
Over-ruling, Ends, that may have
been De?ign'd by Nature in the
Corz?ruction of "the whole Ani
ma .
Secomlly,
(22t)
Second] , . Men ?ometimes erro-'
neoufly Conclude, that ?uch an Of
fice cannot belong to ?uch a Part,
becau?e they think, It is not ?o
Commodiou?iy Framed for it, as
may be wi?h'd or devis'd; with
out con?idering, whether the Stru
cture which they Fancy would do
Better for that Particular u?e,would
not, in ?ome Other as con?iderable
Regard, oppo?e the Welfare of the
Animal : Or, whether it would be
con?i?ent with the Other u?es de
?ign'd by Nature in that ?hrt of
Living Creatures, For in the Li-'
ving Works of ?o Excellent an In
geneer as Nature, it mu? not be
expected, that any Particular End
?hould be pro?ecuted to the Preju
dice of the Whole; but rather it
mu? be ?uppos'd, that She Aims
not only at Particular Expedients,
but Univer?al Symmetry ; and does
indeed excellently Fit the ?everal
Parts, for their re?pective Offices;
but yet' only as far forth as a due
Regard to the De?ign and Welfarctz
' o
(222)
of the Whole will permit. The
Rea?onablene?s of this Ob?ervation, *
One need but be moderately Exer<
cis'd in Zpotomy (as That is di
' ?ingui?h'd from Ahtlratamj) to
di?cern. For,tho7 Man be confe?s'd
5 to be the mo? Perfectly Fram'd
Animal in the World; yet, His'
Body is not made the Model , on'v
which Nature has Fram"d the Cor
re?pondent Parts 0fOther Animals;
The Lungs-of -Dogs, of Birds, of
- Frogs and-Vipers, land I know not
how- many Other-s, are of a Stru
cture veirly differing from Tho?e of '
Man. .e is not furni?h'd with ?o"

vis'el to ?ay', That the-Secretion of

Livers, wherein Such a Cy?is is not
to be??met with : Since in Some A-'
? ct mals,
(223)
mals, as in xHor?es and Pigeons,
that BitterHumour, (which in
Fragr I have often obervedto be of
a Deep and Tran?parent Green,) is
'not u?ually, as in Man, collected
into one 'Bag : And in Vipers, tho'
it be included in one Cy?is, yet, as
far as I have ob?erved, That Bag
does not at all touch the Liver:
And ?ore of ?iich In?ances may
be met with among the-Remarks
of lootomi?s : Wherefore] pa?;
on to Ob?erve,
_i That, 'the Third: place; 'Tis
Difficult to I-Det'ermine the True
and Primary U?e of a Part'-,- becau?e -
Namre does often Fit One-'Part ?or
Several u?es; To which I ?hall add,
In the Foartlzfplace, That the
Difficulty is ?ometimes Increas'd,
becau?e Nature may compa?s the
Same End by Several Means, each
of them Sufficiently, tho' not E
qually, Commodious. I joyn the?e
Two together, becau?e in Effiact
they
(2i4)
they do often Concur, in making
it Difficult to determin the True
u?e of a Part. And the latter of
the Two is ?ometimes Increas'd by
this, that Nature does not as Con
?antly, as ?ome Men pre?ume She
does , Imploy only one Part to
perform ?uch an Office; .but the
Intended Effect is ?ometimes pro
duc'd by a Series of ?ucce??ive Ope
rations, to which ?everal Parts may
in Differing manners contribute.
And here Iob?erve, (what per
haps has not been Con?ider'd,) that
neither the Mechani?m of a Human
Body, nor that of very Con?idera
ble Parts of It, is to be judg'dof,
only by the Structure of the Vi?ible
Parts, whether they be tho?e Solid
_ or Stable Ones that the Anatomi?'s
Knife is wont to expo?e to Sight ;
or even by the Texture of tho?e
Fluid Ones, which are to be found
in the Ve??els and Cavities of a
Dead Body. when Di??ected , tho'
never ?o skilfully. ForI take the
Body
(=2s??)
' Body of a Living Man to be alvery
compounded En'gine, ?uch as Me
chanicians. would call lzfivdrtzttlt'co
ii; Pne/tmtttt'tdl ; Many o? who?e Fun
7' ctions, (i? not the Chie?e?h) are
perform'd , not by the Blood and
other Vt?ihle Fluid: barely as they
are Liquors; but partly by their
Circulating and other' Motions ;
and partly by a very Agile and In
Vi?ible ?ort of Fluids, call'd Spirits,
Vital a'nd Animal ; and Partly per
haps, (as I have ?ometimes gues'd,)
by little Spring)- Partitler ; and
'perhaps too, by lbmewhat that
may be call'd the Vital Portion of
the Air ; and by Things Analogous
to Local Ferment: : the Important
A Operations of all which are wont
to Cea?e with Life, and the Agents
them?elves are not to be Di?ern'd
in a Dead Body. So that, be?ides
tho?e Manife? U?es, which the Vi
?ible Fabrick of the Engine may
?ugge? to an Anatomi?; there
may be Chymical u?es (if [may
?o call them) of flame Parts, that
(L ?erve

?erve Forthe Elaboration of Spirits" '
and other Fluids : Which u?es, (as
'twas formerly ob?erv'd, and yet
ought to be Inculcatech) are not
?ugge?ed to the Anatomi?s, as
Such, by the In?pection of the Stru- 1
cture of the Parts ; xbut to Di?cem ??
them maywrequire no mean Skill
in Spagyrical Principles-and Ope
rations. 5 z
Such con?iderations as the fore
going, make me think it more dif
ficult- than many do, >,to-\determin
with any certainty the Main u?e
of divers Particular Parts, I: for. itfi
?ome Others it ?eems manife? er
nough ; ] e?pecially, if it be done
with the Exclu?ion of; Ogherll?esz
Nor is it enough', to secure us that
we know the Chief-Punction and

PROP. V.
I come now to the La? Caution'
I would recommend to you, about
the Con?ideration of Fiaal Cau?as;
and I ?hall pre?ent it you in this
Propofition: That the Natttrah?
?hould not ?uffer the Search or the
Dt?m/er] of a Final Cau?e of Na
r zttre's Workgto make him Under-value
or Neglect' the ?ttdt'atts Ittalagatim of
their Efflcient Caa?as.
' ' Is true, that to Inquire, To
what Purpo?e Nature would
have ?uch or ?uch EffeCts produc'd,
is a Curio?ity worthy of a att'oaal
Creature , upon the ?core of his
being ?o. But this is not the pro.
per Task of a Nataralt?l , who?e
Work, as he is Such, is not ?o much
to Di?cover why, as haw, Particular
Effects
(zsol
Effects are Produc'd. A Country
Fellow here in England knows
?omething of a Watch, becau?e he
is able to tell you, that 'tis an In
?rument that an Artificer made
to Mea?ure Time by: and That is
more than every Amerz'am Savage
would be able to tell you; and
a more than tho?e Civiliz'd Cht'tte?e!
knew, that took the fir? Watch
the Je?uit brought thither, for a
Living Creature. But the Engli?h
Countryman, that knows no more
of a Watch, than that'twas made
to ?hew the Hour of the Day, does
very little under?and the Nature
of It. And whereas the two scopes,
that Men are wont to Aim at in the
Study of Phy?icks, are to Under
?and, haw and after what man
ner Nature Produces the Phzehome
man we Contemplate ; and, in ca?e
it be Imitable by L'ls, how We may,
if Occa?ion require, Produce the
Like Effizct, or come as Near it- as
may be : The?e Ends cannot be
attai-ned by the bare Knowledg tpf

'the FinalCau?es of Things, nor of
the General, Efficient. But to
'An?wertholh'Aiimg we mu? know
the Particular Efficients, and the
Manner andPrOgre?s of their Ope
rating, and what Di?po?itions they
either 'Find or Produce in the Mat
ter they work upon: as, He that
would throughly under?and the
Nature' of a Watch, mu? not re?
?atisfied 'with knowing in General,
that a Man Made it, and that he
Made it£for ?uch u?es ; but he mu?
Particularly know, of what Mate
rials, the, Spring, the Wheels, the
String or Chain, and the Ballance,
are'made I He mu? know the Num
ber of the Wheels, their Bignels,
their Shape, their Situation and
connexion in the Engine, and af
ter what manner One Part Moves
\ the Other in the whole Series of
Motions, from the Expan?ive En
deavour of the Spring, to the Mo
tion ofthe Imlcx that Points at the
Hours. And much more mu? a
(LA- Mecha
( 23 2 )
Mechanician know this, if he
means to be able to Make a Watch
Him?elf, or Give ?ufficient In?ru
ctions to Another Man, that is
more Handy , to do it for him,
In ?hort, the Neglect of Effltient
Cuu?er would render Phy?iology

I mention in the Hi?ory of Colours,
concerning the great Wantity of
Light, that is' Reflected by White
Objects, in compari?on of tho?e
that are otherwi?e Colour'd. And
this Ob?ervation it Self was con

Knew a Gentleman that had a
Cataract growing,which,when
Ilook'd on his Eye in-a light?om
place, appear'd to cover almo?
ju? the upper Part ofthe Pupil;
and tho' He were a Young Vigorous
Per?on, and the Weather was ve
ry Clear, he could not well di?cern
Men from Women cro?s the
Street. But this Gentlemans Mis
fortune came by a great Stroke he
received onth at Sid e of his Head,
wher eof he?hew*d me the Scar;
' ' * ' ' ' which
(247)
which Circum?ance I therefore
Note, becau?e when no Outward
- Violence has been offer'd to the
Eye, it has been ob?erved by a good
Oculi?, and, if Imi?remember not,
Ihave Seen an In?ance 0fit,That
a ?mall Part of the Pupil, left un
cover'd fiby the Cataract, would
?erve for more Sight than the Gen
tleman enjoy'd. In him likewi?e I
had a further confirmation , of
whatI was lately Ob?erving about
the Con?picuou?ne?s of White Ob
jects. For tho' he could not, asI
was ?aying, di?cern Men and
Women that pa?s'd by, on the 0
ther Side of the Street, yet, having
once de?ired him to tell me, if he t
could di?ingui?h any Objeflt there,
he told me that he could ', and
that I might no longer Doubt of it,
when I asked him what he ?aw, he
laid that it was a Woman that
pa?s'd by with a White Apron,
which Apron he ?aw directly,
and therefore might ea?ily con.
clude, without di?inctly ieeing the

a True Cataract, ?ince Others and I
al?o have ob?erv'd them to continue
many years without being more

Eyes, Who not naturally'Wanting
the Faculty o?Seeing,tho' thus Hin

?o happily Couched, as afterwards
ct to have the benefit of Sight in them
both.
OBSERV. VII.
IT has been of late the Opinion
* ofvery Learned men, that tho
Both our Eyes be Open and turn'd
towards'an Object, yet 'tis but One
of them at a time that is effectually
Imployed in giving us the Repre
?entation of it. Which Opinion, in
this place where I am writing but
Ob?ervations, it were not proper to
Di?cu?s ; e?pecially becau?e what
is ?uppos'd to be ob?erv'd, will not
always Uni?ormly happen , but
may much Vary in particular Per
?ons , according to their ?everal
Cu?oms , and the Con?itution of
their Eyes. For Ihave, by an Ex
periment purpo?ely made, ?everal
times
( 154 )
times found, that my Two Eyes
Together ?ee an Object in another
Situation , than Either of them
Apart would do. On the other
?ide; I met with a Perlbn , who
told me he had a Cataract in his
Eye for two Years, without di?cer
ning that he had any ?uch Impedi
ment in either of his Eyes; and
when I ask'd him, how he knew
that, he an?wer'd me, that others
had taken notice of a. white Filme
that cro?s'd his Eye, ?o long before
he him?elf did. But not knowing
what a Cataract was, and not find
ing himto complain of it at all him
?elf, the Thing remain'd unheeded,
till the Patient,- having one day oc
ca?ion to Rub his Sound Eye, whil?
the Lid cover'd it, was ?adly Sur
priz'd to ?ind him?ialf altogether
in the Dark; and then re?orting
to an Oculi?, was a??ur'd it was a
Cataract, which, awhile before I
met with him, had been Couch'd.
But notwith?anding this Relation,
what I had try'd about the u?ing
of
(zss)
t of Both Eyes, made. me ask of' a
, very ingenious Per?on, that by an
Accident had ?ome mouths before
one ofhis Eyes ?truck out, whether
he did not ob?erve, that upon the
being confin'd to the u?e of One Eye
he was apt to mi?ake the Situati
on and Di?ances of things. To
which he an?wer'd me, that have
ing frequently occa?ion to pour
Di?ill'd Waters and other Liquors
out ofone Vial into an other, after
this Accident he often Spilt his
Liquors, by pouring quite Be?ides
the necks of the Vials he thought
he was pouring them directly Into.
Afterwards inquiring of a Gentle
man that was a Goodfellow , and
had bya Wound a while before
lo? the u?e of One of his Eyes; he
con?e?s'd to me, that diverstimes
pouringthe Wine out of one Ve??el,
into another , he would mi?s the
Orifice of the Bottle or Gla?s'that
. ?hould receive it, and expo?e him
?elf to the merriment of the Com
PanY- A yet more con?iderable In
?ance

?ance of Such Mi?akes,l after
who having in a Fight, where he
play'd the Here, had one of his
Eyes ?rangely Shot out, by a Mus
quet-Bullet that vcame out at his
Mouth; an?wer'd me, that not only
he could not well Pour Drink
out of one Ve??el into another, but
' - had Broken many Gla??es, by let
ting them fall out of His Hand,
?? when he thought he had put them
into Anotherspr ?et them down up
on a Table. And he added, that
this aptne?se to misjudge of Di
?ances and Situations continued
with him, tho' not in the ?ame De
gree, for little le?s than Two Years.
But on this occa?ion I?hall take
notice that, I have often imployed
a Dextrous Artificer, who?e Right
Eye. (for in his Left there is nothing
more remarkable) is con?antly
drawn ?o much a ?ide towards the
'greater Angle of the Eye, that the
Edge of the Pupil does almo?'
?carce
wards had froma Noble Per?on , ,_
touch it and one would think it =
trsr)
e ?carce po??ible,- but that he ?hould
, ?ee the Object double with two Eyes
' that ?eem ?o very differingly turn'd;
and yet 'he anlwer'd me, 'that he
does not ?ee at all, nor that he ?inds
any Inconvenience, ?ave the Defor
'mity of this unu?ual Situation of
his Right Eye, which hinders him
not from Reading as freely, as other
v Men. This Accident happend to
him by an unwary Mi?ake of Sub
limate for another thing; after
which, it ?eems one of the Mu?cles
that mov'd the Eye, remain'd Con
tracted. Butthis having happen'd
to him, as I found by Inquiry, ever
?ince he was two Years of Age;
he could not remember whether he
had ?een Objects Double, before he'
was raccu?iom'd to judge of them
by the help of his other Sen?es, and
the Information of Others.

' ITmaybe worth while to Ob?erve, '
that a very great Di?ention
may be made of the Parts of the

Eye, without Spoiling the Sight;
Of which I lately ?aw an In?ance
ctin a Patient of that Ingenious and
Experienced Oculi?, Dr. Turber
vuill. This was a Gentlewoman
.about one or two and twenty years
of Age, Whole Complexion and
Features would have made her
Hand?om, if ?he had not had that
?ort of Eyes, which tho' rarely
z- met with, ?ome call Ox-Eyes ;
for, Hers were ?welPd much be
yond- the lize of Human Eyes, in
?o much, that ?he complain'd, they
often frighted tho?e that ?aw Her,
and were indeed ?o Big, that ?he
could not move them to the Right
Hand or the Left, but was con.
Prrain'd to look Ptrait forward; or
if ?he would ?ee an object that
lay A?ide, ?he was oblig'd to turn
her Whole Head that way. And
?o ?he an?wer'd me ?he was, when
ihe let her?elf to Read in a Book,
unle?s ?he did with her Hand move
the Book from one ?ide to another,
to bring the ends of the Lines di
rectly
( 259 )
rectly before her Eyes. She told
me her Eyes did not always retain
the ?ame mea?ure of Tumidne?s,
andtthat the very day I ?aw them,
they' had been in the Morning much
more swell'd than when" I look'd
upon Her. But that which was
more remarkable, was, that not
only ?he could, for all this, See
very well and di?inctly, and, as
I ju? now intimated, could Read
Books, but her Sight had continued
good, tho' ?he had this Di?emper
the?e twelve years. And, which
'is more ?range, ?he an?wer'd me,
that her Vi?ive Power was ?o little
Preiudic'd by this Di?emper, when
it fir? came upon her, that ?he ne*
ver knew any thing was ami?s in
her' Eyes, till her Friends told her
'of it, when they found it had con
tinued too long to be a meerly Ca
?ual and Tran?ient Tumor. But,
tho' this odd Accident did not Im,
pair her Sight, it occa?ion'd great
Pains in her Eyes, for which ?he
took Purging and other Medicines,
S 2 with
(a6??o
with ?o little Succe?s, that both?he
and her former Phy?icians, thought.- .
her ca?e De?perate; there appear
ing no way ofdillodging a. Humour
?o long ?ettled there. Upon which
I propos'd Salivation, as the lea?
unlikely way that remain'd, to Re
?olve and carry off the Peccant
Humour. But this, tho' much ap
prov'd by her Do?or, the Mode?
Patient would by no means con
?ent to.

di?cern nothing that was Ami?s,

the Narrowne?s of her Pupils,

And yet this Woman was much
troubled with Fumes and Weak

OBSE Rv. XIV.
Ome may think that a Man has
s rather an Excellent,than a Viti
ated Sight, who can See Octjects
with a far le?s degree of Light than
other Men have need of to Di?cern
them. But tho' an Extraordinary
Tenderne?s may be a kind of Per
fection in the Eyes of Bat: and owls,
who?e u?ual Food may be more ea
lily Purcha?ed by Twilight : Yet
as to Man, the main part ofwho?e
Actions is to be perform'd by
the Light of the Day, or ?ome
other almo? Eq-uivalent ; it may
Argue the provident goodn'e?s of the
Author of Nature, to have given
Him Eyes Con?ituted as thol?sI of

( 272 >
Men generally are: Since, Thata
very great Tenderne?s of theRetina,
or principal part of the Organ of
Sight, would be, if not an Imper
fection, at lea? a great Inconve
nience, may appear by the Memo
rable Story I am going to Rela'te.
'In-the Army of the late King
o? Hapy Memory, (Charles the
Fir?) there was a Gentleman
of great Courage and good Parts,
that was Major to one of the
Regiments ; who being after
wards by the prevailing ll?urpers
forc'd to ?eek his Fortune abroad,
ventur'd to do his King a piece of
Service at Madrz'd, which was of an
Extraordinary Nature and Con?e
quence, and there judg'd very Ir
regular. Upon this he was com
mitted to an uncommon Pri?on,
which, tho' otherwi?e Tolerable e
nough, had no window at all be
longing to it, but a Hole in the
thickne?s o? the Wall, at which
the Keeper once or twice a day put
v in
(273)
in liberal provi?ion of Victuals and
Wine, and pre?ently Clos'd the
Window , if it may be ?o call'd,
on the Out-?ide, but not perhaps
very Solicitou?ly. For ?ome Weeks
this poor Gentleman continu'd in '
the Dark, very Di?con?olate. But
afterwards he began to think he
?aw ?ome little Glimering of Light,
which from time to time Increa?ed;
in?omuch, that he could not only
Di?cover the Parts of his Bed,
and other ?uch large Objects, but
at length came to Di?coverthings
?o Minute, that he could Perceive
the Mice that frequented his Cham
ber, to eat the Crumbs of Bread
that fell upon the Ground, and
Di?cern their Motions very well.
Several other Effects of his Sight
in that Dark Place He Related. And
that which Confirms that this Pro
ceeded mainly from the great Ten
derne?s the Vi?ive Organ had acqui
red, by ?o long a ?ay in ?o Ob?cure
a Place, was, that when after ?ome
Months, the Face of Affairs Abroad
being
(274) .
being ?omwhat Chang'd, His Li
berty was re?or'd him, he dur?
not leave his'Pri?on Abruptly, for
fear of lo?ing his Sight by the Daz
ling Light ofthe Day', and there
fore was fain to Accu?om his Eyes
* by ?lowdegrees to the Light. This
strange, as well as once Famous
Story,l the le?s Scruple to ?et down
in this Place, becau?e I had the
Curio?ity to learn it from the Gent
tleman's own Mouth, who acquain
ted me with other Particulars about
it, that, ?or want of the Notes I
then took, I ?hall not now venture
to "?peak of.
