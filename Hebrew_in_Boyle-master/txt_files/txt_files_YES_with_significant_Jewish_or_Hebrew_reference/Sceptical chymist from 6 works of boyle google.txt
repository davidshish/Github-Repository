THE
SCEPTICAL CHYMIST:
PARTI.
I AM (fays Carneades) fo unwilling to deny Eleutberius any thing, that though, before
the reft of my company, I am refolved to make good the part I have undertaken
of afceptic; yet I ftiall readily, fincc you will have it fo, lav afide for a while
the perfon of an adverfary to the Peripatetics and Chymifts ; and before I acquaint
you with my objections again ft their opinions, acknowledge to you, what may be
(whether truly or not) tolerably enough added, in favour of a certain number of
principles of mixt bodies, to that grand and known argument from the analyfis of
compound bodies, which I may poflibly hereafter be able to confute.
And that you may the more eafily examine, and the better judge of what I have
to lay, I lhall caft it into a pretty number of diftind propofitions, to which I Ihall
not premife any thing , becaufe I take it for granted, that you need not be advertifed,
that much of what I am to deliver, whether for or againft a determinate number
of ingredients of mixt bodies, may be indifferently applied to the four Peripatetic
elements, and the three chymical principles, though divers of my objections will
more peculiarly belong to thefe laft named j becaufe the chymical hypothecs feeming
to be much more countenanced by experience than the other, it will be expedient
to infill chiefly upon the difproving of that •, efpecially iince moft of the arguments,
that are employed againft it, may, by a little variation, be made to conclude,
at leaft as ftrongly againft the lefs plaufible Ariftotelian doctrine.
To proceed then to my propofitions, I lhall begin with this, that
Jt feems not abfurd to conceive, that at tbefirft producliqn of mixt todies, the univerfal
matter, whereof tbey among other parts of tbe univerfe confifted, was aclually divided*
into little particles, of feveralfizes andfhapes, varioufiy moved.
This (fays Carneades) I fuppofe you will eafily enough allow. For befides that,
which happens in the generation, corruption, nutrition, and wafting of bodies, that,
which we difcover partly by our microfcopes of the cxtream ljttlenefs of even the
lcarce lenfiblc parts of concretes, and partly by the chymical rcfolutions of mixt
bodies, and by divers other operations of fpagyrical fires upon them, feems fufficiently
to manifeft their confifting of parts very minute, and of differing figures. And
that there docs alfo intervene a various local motion of fuch fmall bodies, will lcarce
be denied ; whether we chufe to grant the origin cf concretions afligned by Epicurus,
or that related by Mofes. For the firft, as you well know, fuppofes not only all mixt
bodies, but all others to be produced by the various and cafual occurfions of atoms,
moving thcmfclvcs to and fro by an internal principle in the immenfe or rather infinite
vacuum.

Vacuum. And as for the infpircd hiftorian, he, informing us, that the great and
wife author of things did not immediately create plants, beafts, birds, fcfe. but produced
them out of thofe portions of the pre-exiftent, though created, matter, that
he calls water and earth, allows us to conceive, that the conftituent particles, whereof
thefe new concretes were to confift, were varioufly moved, in order to their being
connected into the bodies they were, by their various coalitions and textures, to
compofe.
But (continues Carneades) prcfuming, that the firft propofition needs not be longer
infilled on, I will pafs on to the fecond, and tell you that
Neither is it impofftUe that of thefe minute particles divers of the fmalleft and neighbour- ft* »
ing ones were here and there officiated into minute maffes or clufters, and did by their
coalitions eonftitutc great flare of fucb little primary concretions or maffes, as were not
eafily diffipaile intofucb particles, as compofed them.
To what may be deduced, in favour of this aflertion from the nature of the thing
itfclf, I will add fomething out of experience •, which, though I have not known i:
ufed to fuch a purpofe, feems to me more fairly to make out, that there may be elementary
bodies, than the more queftionable experiments of Peripatetics and Chymifts
prove, that there arc fuch. I confider then, that gold will mix and be colliquated
not only with filver, copper, tin and lead, but with antimony, Regulus Marlis, and
many other minerals, with which it will conrfpofe bodies very differing both from gold,
and the other ingredients of the refuking concretes. And the fame gold will alio by
common aqua regis, and (I fpeak it knowingly) by divers other menftruums be reduced
into a feeming liquor, infbmuch, that the corpufcles of gold will, with tRofe
of the menftruum, pafs through cap-paper, and with them alfo coagulate into a cryftalline
fait. And I have further tried, that with a fmall quantity of a certain faline
fubftance I prepared, I can eafily enough fublime gold into the form of red cryftals,
of a confiderable length ; and many other ways may gold be difguifed, and help to
conftitute bodies of very differing natures both from it and from one another, and
neverthelefs be afterward reduced to the felf-fame numerical, yellow, fixt, ponderous
and malleable gold it was before its commixture. Nor is it only the fixedeft of
metals, but the mod fugitive, that I may employ in favour of our propofition : for
quickfilver will, with divers metals, compofe an amalgam ; with divers menftruums, •
it lccms to be turned into a liquor ; with aqua forth, it will be brought into either a
red or white powder, or precipitate •, with oil of vitriol, into a pale yellow one ; with
fulphur, it will compofe a blood- red and volatile cinabar •, with fome faline bodies,
it will afcend in form of a fair, which will be diffoluble in water •, with tegulus of
antimony and filver, I have feen it fublimed into a kind of cryftals with another
mixture, I reduced it into a malleable body, into a hard and brittle fubftance by
another : and fome there are, who afnrm, that by proper additaments they can reduce
quickfilver into oil, nay into glafs, to mention no more. And yet out of all thefe
exotic compounds, wc may recover the very lame running mercury, that was the
main ingredient of them, and was fo difguifed in them. Now the reafon (proceeds
Carneades) that I have reprefented thefe things concerning gold anil quickfilver, is,
that it may not appear abfurd to conceive, that fuch little primary maffes or clutters,
as our propofition mentions, may remain undlffipaced, notwithftant!ing their entering
into the compofition of various concretions, fincc the corpufdes of gold and mer- •

airy, though they be not primary concretions of the moft minute particles of matter,
but confeffedly mixed bodies, arc able to concur plentifully to the compoiition of
feveral very differing bodies, without lofing their own nature or texture, or having
their cohefion violated by the divorce of their aflbciated parts or ingredients.
Give me leave to add (fays Eleutbmus) on this occafion, to what you now obferved,
that as confidently as fome chymifts, and other modern innovators in philofophy
arc wont to object againft the Peripatetics, that from the mixture of their four
elements there could arife but an inconfiderable variety of compound bodies •, yet,
if the Ariftotelians were but half as well verfed in the works of nature, as they arc
in the writings of their mailer, the propofed objection would not fo calmly triumph,
as for want of experiments they are fain to fuffcr it to do. For if we affign to the
corpufcles, whereof each element confifts, a peculiar fize and fhape, it may eafiiy
enough be manifefted, that fuch diffcringly-figured corpufcles may be mingled in fuh
various proportions, and may be connected To many feveral ways, that an almoft incredible
number of varioully qualified concretes may be compofed of them. Efpe-
.cially fincc the corpufcles of one element may barely, by being allbciared among
themfelves, make up little mafies of differing fize and figure from their conftituent
parts : and fince alfo, to the ftndt union of fuch minute bodies there ieems oftentimes
nothing rcquifite, befides the bare contact of a great pan of their furfaces.
And how great a variety of phaenomena the fame matter, without the addition of
any other, and only feveral ways difpolcd or contexed, is able to exhibit, may partly
appear by the multitude of differing engines, which by the contrivances ot fkilful
mechanicians, and the dexterity of expert workmen, may be made of iron alone.
Bu^ in our prefent cafe, being allowed to deduce compound bodies from four very
differently qualified forts of matter, he, who fhall but confider, what you frefhly
took notice of, concerning the new concretes refulting from the mixture of incorporated
minerals, will fcarce doubt, but that the four* elements, managed by nature a
Ikill, may afford a multitude of differing compounds.
I am thus far of your mind (fays Carntadts) that the Ariftotelians might with probability
deduce a much greater number of compound bodies from the mixture of
their four elements, than according to their prefent hypothefis they can, if inftead of
vainly attempting to deduce the variety and proprieties of all mixed bodies from the
combinations ana temperaments of the four elements, as they are (among them) endowed
with the four firft qualities, they had endeavoured to do it by the bulk and
figure of the fmalleft parts of thofe fuppoled elements. For from thefe more catholic
and fruitful accidents of the elementary matter may fpring a great variety of
textures, upon whofe account a multitude of compound bodies may very much differ
from one another. And what I now obferve touching the four Peripatetic elements,
may be alfo applied, mutatis mutandis (as they fpeak) to the chymical principles. But
(to take notice of that by the by) both the one and the other muft, I fear, call into
their affiftancc fomcthing, that is not elementary, to excite or regulate the motion of
the parts of the matter, and difpofe them after the manner rcquifite to the conftitution
of particular concretes. For that othcrwifc they are like to give us but a very imiicrtect
account of the origin of very many mixed bodies, it would, I think, be no
i.trd matter to pcrfuade you, if it would not fpend time, and were no digreffion, to
examine, what they are wont to alledge of the origin of the textures and qualities of
mixed bodies, from a certain fubftantial form, whofe origination they leave more
ohucure than what it is allumcd to explicate.

But to proceed to a new propofition.
477
JJball not peremptorily deny, that from moft of fucb mixed bodies, as partake either of ani- P~f. nt
mal or vegetable nature, there may, by the help of the fire, be actually obtained a determinate
number (whether three, four, or Jive, or fewer or more) of fubftances, worthy
of differing denominations.
Of the experiments, that induce me to make this conceffion, I am like to have occafion
enough to mention feveral in the profecution of my difcourfe. And therefore,
that I may not hereafter be obliged to trouble you and myfclf with needlefs repetitions,
I lhall now only define you to take notice of fuch experiments, when they
ihall be mentioned, and in your thoughts refer them hither.
To thefe three conoeflions, I have but this fourth to add, that
// may likewife be granted, that thofe diftincl fubftances, which concretes generally either t^, |*.
afford, or are made up of, may, without very much inconvenience, be called the elements
or principles of them.
Whew I laid, without very much inconvenience, I had in my thoughts that fobcr
admonition of Galen, cum de re conftat, de verbis mm eft Utigandum. And therefore
alio I fcruple not to fay, elements or principles, partly becaufe the chymifts are wont
to call the ingredients of mixed bodies, principles, as the Ariftotelians name them,
elements •, I would here exclude neither : and, partly becaufe it feems doubtful, whether
the fame ingredients may not be called principles , as not being compounded of
any more primary bodies ; and elements, in regard that all mixed bodies are compounded
of them. But I thought it requifite to limit my conceffion, by premifing
the words, very much, to the word inconvenience ; becaufe, that though the inconvenience
of calling the diftind fubftances, mentioned in the propofition, elements or
principles, be not very great, yet that it is impropriety of fpecch, and confequcntly
in a matter of this moment not to be altogether overlooked, you will perhaps think,
as well as I, by that time you Hull have heard the following part of my difcourfe,
by which you will beft difcern what conftruction to put upon the former propofitions,
and how far they may be looked upon, as things that 1 concede as true, and how
far as things 1 only rcprefent as fpecious enough to be fit to be confidcrcd.
And now Eleutherius (continues Cameades) 1 mud relume the perfon of a fceptic,
and, as fuch, propofe fome part of what may be cither difiiked, or at leaft doubted
of, in the common hypothefis of the chymifts •, which if I examine with a little the
more freedom, I hope I need not defire you (a perfon to whom I have the happinels
of being fo well known) to look upon it as fomcthing more fuitablc to the employment,
whereto die company has, for this meeting, doomed me, than either to my
humour or my cuftom.
Now though I might prefent you many things againft the vulgar chymical opinion
of the three principles, and the experiments wont to be alledged as demonftr.uions of
it; yet thofe I fhall at prefent offer you, may be conveniently enough comprehended
in four capital confutations : touching all which I fhall only premi'e this in general,
that fince it is not my prefent talk fo much to aftcrt an hypothefis of my own, as to
give an account wherefore I fufpect the truth of that of the chymifts, it ou<-!u not
to be expected, that all my objections fhouid be of the ir.cft cogent fort, fince it is

reafon enough to doubt of a propofed opinion, that there appears no cogent reafon
for it.
To come then to the objections themfelves j I confider in the firft place, that notwithftandingwhat
common chymifts have proved or taught, it may rcafonably enough
he doubted, how far, and in what fenfe, fire ought to be cftcemed the genuine and
univcrfal inftrumcnt of analyzing mixed bodies.
This doubt, you may remember, was formerly mentioned, but fo tranfiently difcourfed
of, that it will now be fit to infift upon it } and manifeft, that it was not fo
inconfidcrately propofed as our adverfaries then imagined.
But, before I enter any further into this dilquifition, I cannot but here take notice,
that it were to be wifhed, our chymifts had clearly informed us, what kind of
divifion of bodies by fire mult determine the number of the elements : for it is nothing
near fo cafy, as many fcem to think, to determine diftin&ly the effects of heat,
as I could cafily manifeft, if I had leifure to fhew you, how much the operations of
fire may be diverfified by circumftances. But not wholly to pafs by a matter of th»
importance, I will firft take notice to you, that guaiacum (for inftance) burnt with
an open fire in a chimney, is fequeftered into allies and foot, whereas the fame wood,
diftilled in a retort does yield far other heterogeneities (to ufe the Helmontian cxpreffion)
and is refolved into oil, fpirit, vinegar, water and charcoal ; the laft of which,
to be reduced into afties, requires the being farther calcined than it can be in a clofe
veffel. Befides, having kindled amber, and held a clean filver fpoon, or fomc other
concave and fmooth veflel, over the fmoke of its flame, I obferved the foot, into
which that fume condenfed, to be very differing from any thing, that I had obferved
to proceed from the fteam of amber purpofely (for that is not ufual) diftilled per ft
in clofe veflels. Thus having, for trial's fake, kindled camphirc, and catched the
fmoke, that copioufly afcended out of the flame, it condenfed into a black and undu*
ous foot, which would not have been gueffed by the fmell or other properties to have
proceeded from camphire : whereas having (as I fhall otherwhere more fully declare)
cxpofed a quantity of that fugitive concrete to a gentle heat in a clofe glafs-veffel, it
fublimed up without feeming to have loft any thing of its whitenefs, or its nature \
both which it retained, though afterwards 1 fo increafed the fire, as to bring it to
fufion. And, befides camphire, there are divers other bodies (that I elfewherc name)
in which the heat in clofe veflels is not wont to make any feparation of heterogeneities,
but only a comminution of parts, thofe that rife firft being homogeneal with the
others, though fubdivided into fmaller particles: whence fublimations have been
ftyk-d, Tbe PeftUs of (be Chymifts. But not here to mention what 1 elfewhere take
notice of, concerning common brimftone once or twice fublimed, that, expofcd to a
moderate fire in fubliming-pots, it rifes all into dry, and almoft taftelefs, flowers
whereas being expofed to a naked fire, it affords ftore of a faline and fretting liquor
not to mention this, I fay, I will further obferve to you, that as it is confiderable in
the analyfis of mixt bodies, whether the fire act on them, when they arc cxpofed to
the open air, or fhut up in clofe veflels, fo is the degree of fire, by which the analyfis
is attempted, of no fmall moment. For a mild balneum will fever unfermented
blood (for inftance) but into phlegm and caput morluum, the latter whereof (which I
have fomctimes had) hard, brittle, and of divers colours (tranfparcnt almoft like
tortoHe-Jhell) preffed by a good fire in a retort yields a fpirit, an oil or two, and a volatile
f.ilt, befides another caput morluum. It may be alio pertinent to our prefent defigu,
to take notice of what happens in the making and dillilling of foapi for by one

degree of fire, the fait, the water, and the oil or greafe, whereof that fa&itious
concrete is made up, being boiled up together, are eafily brought to mingle ami incorporate
into one mafs ; but by another and further degree of heat, the fame mafs
may be again divided into an oleaginous and aqueous, a faline and an earthy part.
And fo we may obferve, that impure filver and lead being expofed together to a moderate
fire, will thereby be colliquated into one mafs, and mingle per minima, as they
fpeak j whereas a much vehementer fire will drive or carry off the bafer metals (I
mean the lead, and the copper or other alloy) from the filver, though not, for aught
appears, feparate them from one another. Befides, when a vegetable abounding in
fixed fait is analyzed by a naked fire, as one degree of heat will reduce it into afhes,
(as the chymifts themfclves teach us) fo, by only a further degree of fire, thofe afhes
may be vitrified and turned into glafs. I will not ftay to examine, how far a mere
chymift might on this occafion demand, if it be lawful for an Ariftotelian to make
aflies (which he miftakes for mere earth) pafs for an element, becaufe by one degree
of fire it may be produced, why a chymift may not upon the like principle argue,
that glafs is one of the elements of many bodies, becaufe that alio may be obtained
from them, barely by the fire ? I will not, I fay, lofe time to examine this, but obferve,
that by a method of applying the fire, fuch fimilar bodies may be obtained
from a concrete, as chymifts have not been able to feparate j either by barely burning
it in an open fire, or by barely diftilling it in clofe veflcls. For to me it feems very
confiderable, and I wonder, that men have taken fo little notice of it, that 1 have
not, by any of the common ways of diftillation in clofe veffels, fcen any fcparation
made of fuch a volatile fait as is afforded us by wood, when that is firft by an open
fire divided into afhes and foot, and that foot is afterwards placed in a ftrong retort,
and compelled by an urgent fire to part with its fpirit, oil and fait. For though I
dare not peremptorily deny, that in the liquors of guaiacum and other woods distilled
in retorts after the common manner, there may be faline parts, which by reafon
of the analogy may pretend to the name of fome kind of volatile falts ; yet queftionlefs
there is a great difparity betwixt fuch falts, and that which we have fomctimcs
obtained upon the firft diftillation of foot (though for the moft part it has not been
feparated from the firft or fecond rectification, and fometimcs not till the third). For
we could never yet fee feparated from woods analyzed only the vulgar way in clofe
veflcls, any volatile fait in a dry and faline form, as that of loot, which we have often
had very cryftallinc, and geometrically figured. And then, whereas the faline parts
of the fpirits of guaiacum, idc. appear upon diftillation fluggifh enough, the fait of
foot feems to be one of the moft volatile bodies in all nature ; and if it be well made
will readily afcend with the mild* heat of a furnace, wanned only by the lingle wick
of a lamp, to the top of the higheft glafs veffels that arc commonly made ufc of for
diftillation. And befides all this, the tafte and fmeli of the fait of foot arc exceeding
differing from thofe of the fpirits of guaiacum, iir. and tlv former not only fimlls
and taftes much lcls like a vegetable fuk, than like that of harifnom, and other
animal concretes; but in divers other properties feems more of k n to the family of
animals, than to that of vegetable falts, as I may ellewhere '^God permitting) have
an occafion more particularly to declare. 1 might likewifc by fume other examples
manifeft, that the chymifts, to have dealt clearly, ought to have more explicitly and
particularly declared by what degree of fire, and in what manner of application of
it, thev would have us judge a divifion made by the lire to be a tr.:c fanatyfis into
their principles, ana the productions or" it to deferve the iu;r.c if elcmentr.ry bodies.
But it is. time, that I proceed to mention the particular r.v ins, that incline me tu

doubt, whether the fire be the true and univerfal analyzer of mixt bodies ; of which
realbns, what has been already objected may pafs for one.
In the next place, I obierve, that there are fome mixt bodies, from which it has
not been yet made appear, that any degree of fire can fcparate- either fait, or fulpJiur,
or mercury, much lefs all the three. The rnoft obvious inftancc of this truth is gold,,
which is a body fo fixed, and wherein the elementary ingredients (if it have any) arc
lb firmly united to each other, that wc find not in the operations, wherein gold is
expoledtothe fire, how violent focver, that it does difcernably Co much as loleof its
fixednefs or weight, fo far is it from being diffipated into thole principles, whereof
one at leaft is acknowledged to be fugitive enough j and fo juftly did the fpagyricaL
poet fomewhere exclaim,
Cunfia adto miris silk csmpagibus hacrtnt.
And I mull: not omit on this occafion to mention to you, Eleutherius., the memoes
rablc experiment, that 1 remember I met with in Cafio Clavats* who, though a
ci.,«, lawyer by profeflion, feems to have had no fmall curiofity and experience in chymical
Jr^'a affairs. He relates then, that having put into one fmall earthen veflel, an ounce of
ojjftfj. the rnoft pure gold, and into another the like weight of pure filver, he placed them
both in that part of a glafs-houfe furnace, wherein the workmen keep their metal (as
our Englifli artificers call their liquid glafs) continually melted , and, that having
there kept both the gold and the filver in conftant fufion for two months together,
he afterwards took them out of the furnace and the veffels, and weighing both of
them again, found, that the filver had not loft above a 12th part of its weight, but
the gold had not of his loft any thing at all. And though our author endeavours to
give us of this a fcholaftic realon, which I fuppofe you would be as little fatisfied •
with, as I was when I read it ; yet for the matter of fact, which will ferve our prefent
turn, he affurcs us, that though it be ftrange, yet experience itfclf taught it him
to be rnoft true.
And though there be not perhaps any other body to be found fo perfectly fixed as
gold, yet there are divers others fo fixed or compofed, at leaft of fo ftrictly united
parts, that 1 have not yet obferved the fire to fcparate from them any one of the
t hymifts principles. 1 need not tell you, what complaints the more candid and judicious
of the chymifts themfelves are wont to make of thofe boafters, that confidently
pretend, that they have extracted the fait or fulphur of quickfilvcr, when they have
difguifed it by additaments, wherewith it rcfcmbles -the concretes, whofe names are
given it ; whereas by a fkilful and rigid examen, it may be eafily enough ftripped
of its difguifes, and made to appear again in the priftine form of running mercury.
The pretended falts and fulphurs being fo far from being elementary parts cxtra&ed
out of the body of mercury, that they are rather (to borrow a term of the grammarians)
de-compound bodies, made up of the whole metal and the menftruum, or
other additaments employed to difguifc it. And as for filver, I never could fee any
degree of fire make it part with any of its three principles. And though the experiment
lately mentioned from Claveus may beget a fufpicion, that filver may be diflipatcd
by fire, provided it be extremely violent and very lafting yet it will not neceffarily
follow, that becaufc the fire was able at length to make the filver lofe a little
of its weight, it was therefore able to diflipate it into its principles. For firft I might
allege, that I have obferved little grains of filver to lie hid in the fmall cavities (perhaps
glaffed over by a vitrifying heat) in crucibles, wherein filver has been long kept

In fufion, whence fome goldfmiths of my acquaintance make a benefit by grinding
fuch crucibles to powder, to recover out of them the latent particles of filver. And
hence I might argue, that perhaps Claveus was miftaken, and imagined, that filver
to have been driven away by the fire, that indeed lay in minute parts hid in his crucible,
in whofe pores fo fmall a quantity, as he miffed of fo ponderous a body, might
very well lie concealed.
But fecondly, admitting, that fome parts of the filver were driven away by the
violence of the fire, what proof is there, that it was either the fait, the fulphur, or
the mercury of the metal, and not rather a part of it homogeneous to what remained
? for befides that the filver, that was left, fecmcd not fenfibly altered, which probably
would have appeared, had fo much of any one of its principles been fcparated
from it ; we find in other mineral bodies of a lefs permanent nature than filver, that
the fire may divide them into fuch minute parts, as to be able to carry them away
with itfclf, without at all deftroying their nature. Thus we fee, that in the refining
of filver, the lead, that is mixed with it (to carry away the copper or other ignoble
mineral that embaflcs the filver) will, if it be let alone, in time evaporate away upon
the teft ; but if (as is molt ufual amongft thofe, that refine great quantities of metals
together) the lead be blown off from the filver by bellows, that, which would elfe
Jiave gone away in the form of unheeded fteams, will, in great part, be collected
not far from the filver, in the form of a darkilh powder or calx ; which, becaufe it
Is blown off from filver, they call litharge of filver. And thus Agriccla in divers ApMt it
moft part) white bubbles i which therefore the Greeks, and, in imitation of* them,
our drugfters call pompholyx : and others more heavy partly adhere to the fides of
the furnace, and partly (efpecially if the covers be not kept upon the pots) fall to the
ground, and by reafon of their alhy colour, as well as weight, were called by the
lame Greeks oW«V, which, I need not tell you, in their language fignifies alhes. I
might add, that 1 have not found, that from Venetian talc (I fay Venetian, becaufe I
have found other kinds .of that mineral more open) from the lapis offifragus (which
the fhops call oftiocolla) from Mufcovia glafs, from pure and fufible fand (to mention
now no other concretes) thofe of my acquaintance, that have tried, have been able
by the fire to leparate any one of the hypoftatical principles : which you will the lefs
fcruple to believe, if you confider, that glafs may be made by the bare colliquation
of the fait and earth remaining in the allies of a burnt plant, and that yet common
glafs, once made, does fo far refill the violence of the fire, that moft chymifts think
it a body more undcftroyable than gold itfelf. For if the artificer can fo firmly unite,
Aich comparative grofs particles as thofe of earth and fait, that make up common
alhes, into a body indiffoluble by fire, why may not nature affociate in divers bodies
the more minute elementary corpufcles, Ihe has at hand, too firmly to let them be
feparable by the fire ? And on this occafion, Eleutberius, give me leave to mention
to you two or three flight experiments, which will, I hope, be found more pertinent
to our prefent difcourfe, than at firft perhaps they will appear. The firft is, that,
having (for trial's fake) put a quantity of that fugitive concrete, camphire, into a
glafs veilel, and placed it in a gentle heat, I found it (not leaving behind, according
to my eftimate, not fo much as one grain) to fublime to the top of the veffel into
flowers j which in whitenefs, fmell, &c. feemed not to differ from the camphire itfelf.
Another experiment is that of Htlmnt> who in fcveral place* affirms, that a coal

kept in a glafs exactly clofed will never be calcined to allies, though kept never fo
dole in a ftrong lire. To countenance which, I fhall tell you this trial of my own,
that having fometimes diftilled fome woods, as particularly box, whilft our caput
mortuum remained in the retort, it continued black like charcoal, though the retort
were earthen, and kept red-hot in a vehement lire : but as foon as ever it was brought
out of the candent veflel into the open air, the burning coals did haftily degenerate
or fall afunder, without the afliftance of any new calcination, into pure white alhes.
And to thefe two I /hall add but this obvious and known obfervation, that common
fulphur (if it be pure and freed from its vinegar) being leifurely fublimed in clofe
veflels, rifes into dry flowers, which may be prcfently melted into a body of the fame
nature with that which afforded them. Though, if brimftone be burnt in the open
air, it gives, you know, a penetrating fume, which being caught in a glafs-bell, condenfes
into that acid liquor called oil of fujphur per campanam. The ufc I would
make of thefe experiments, collated with what I lately told you out of Agricola, is
this, that even among the bodies, that are not fixt, there arc divers of fuch a texture,
that it will be hard to make it appear, how the fire, as chymifts are wont to imptoy
ic, can refolve them into elementary fubftances. For fome bodies being of fuch a
texture, that the fire can drive them into the cooler and lefe hot part of the veflels,
wherein they are included, and, if need be, remove them from place to place, to
fly the greateft heat, more eafily than it can divorce their elements (efpecially without
the afliftance of the air) we fee that our chymifts cannot analyze them in clofe veflels,.
and of other compound bodies the open fire can as little feparate the elements. For
what can a naked fire do to analyze a mixt body, if its component principles be fo
minute, and fo ftrictly united, that the corpufcles of it need lefs heat to carry them
up, than is requifite to divide them into their principles ? So that of fome bodies
the fire cannot in clofe veflels make any anah/fis at all j and others will in the open
air fly away in the forms of flowers or liquors, before the heat can prove able ta divide
them into their principles. And this may hold, whether the various fimilar parts of
a concrete be combined by nature or by art •, for in factitious fal armoniac we find the
common and the urinous (alts fo well mingled, that both in the open fire, and in fubliming
veflels they rife together, as one fait, which feems in fuch veflels irrefoluble by
fire alone. For I can fhew you fal armoniac, which after the ninth fublimation docs
ftill retain its compounded nature. And indeed I fcarce know any one mineral, from
which by fire alone chymifts are wont to fever any fubftance fimplc enough to deferve
the name of an element or principle. For though out of native cinnabar they diftil
quickfilvcr, and though from many of thofc ftones, that the antients called Pyrit;s%
they fublime brimftone, yet both that quickfilvcr and this fulphur, being very often
the fame with the common minerals, that arc fold in the fhops under thofe names*
are thcmfelves too much compounded bodies to pals for the elements of fuch. And
thus much, Eleutberius, for the fecond argument, that belongs to my firft confideration
; the odiers I fhall the lefs infift on, becnufc I have dwelt fo long upon this.
Proceed wethen, in the next place, to confiderthat there are divers leparations to
be made by other means, which cither cannot at all, or elfc cannot fo well be made
by the fire alone. When gold and filver arc melted into one mafs, it would lay a
great obligation upon refiners and goldfmirhs, to tench them the art of fcparating
them by tne fire, without the trouble and charge they are fain to be at to fever them.

by a violent fire, as by the aflufion of certain alkalizate falts, in a liquid form, upon
the folution of vitriol made in common water. For thereby the acid fait of the vitriol
leaving the copper, it had corroded, to join with the added falts, the metalline
part will be precipitated to the bottom almolt like mud. And that I may not give
inftances only in decompound bodies, I will add a not ufelefs one of another
kind. Not only chymifts have not been able (for aught is vulgarly known) by fire
alone to feparate true fulphur from antimony i but though you may find in their books
many plaufible procefies of extracting it, yet he, that mall make as many fruitlefsf
trials as I have done to obtain it, by mod of them will, I fuppole, be eafily perfiiaded,
that the productions of fuch procefies are antimonial fulphurs rather in name
than nature. But though antimony fubfimcd by itfelf is reduced but to a volatile
powder, or antimonial flowers, of a compounded nature like the mineral, that afford*
them j yet I remember, that fome years ago I fublimed out of antimony a fulphur, and
that in greater plenty than ever 1 faw obtained from that mineral, by a method, which
I fhall therefore acquaint you with, becaufe chymifts fecm not to have taken notice, of
what importance fuch experiments may be in the indagation of the nature, and cfpecially
of the number of the elements. Having then purpofely for trial fake digefled eight
ounces of good and well powdered antimony witn twelve ounces of oil of vitriol, in a
well ftopped glafs-veflel, for about fix or (even weeks j and having caufed the mafe
(grown hard and brittle) to be diftilled in a retort placed in fand, with a ftrong fire ; we
found the antimony to be fo opened, or altered by the menftruum, wherewith it had
been digefted, that whereas crude antimony forced up by the fire, arifesonty in flowers,
.
our antimony thus handled afforded us partly in the receiver, and partly in the neck
and at the top of the retort, about an ounce of fulphur, yellow and brittle like
common brimftone, and of fo fulphureous a fmell, that upon the unluting the vefiels
it infected the room with a icarce fupportabfe ftink. And this fulphur, befides the
colour and fmell, had the perfect inflammability of common brimftone, and would
immediately kindle (at the flame of a candle) and burn blue like it. And though it
feemed, that the long digeftion, wherein our antimony and menftruum were detained,
did conduce to the better unlocking of the mineral, yet if you have not the leifurC
to make fo long a digeftion, you may, by incorporating with powdered antimony a
convenient quantity of oil of vitriol, and committing them immediately to diftillation,
obtain a little fulphur like unto the common one, and more combuftible than,
perhaps, you will at firft take notice of. For I have obferved, that though (after its
being firft kindled) the flame would fomctimes go out too foon of itfelf, if the fame
lump of fulphur were held again to the flame of a candle, it would be rekindled and
burn a pretty while, not only after the fecond, but after the third or fourth accenfion.
You, to whom I think I Ihewed my way of difcovering fomething of fulphureous
in od of vitriol, may perchance fulpect, Eleutberius, either that this fubftancc
was fome venereal fulphur, that lay hid in that 'liquor, and was by this operation
only reduced into a manifeft body ; or elfe, that it was. a compound of the unctuous
parts of the antimony, and the faline ones of the vitriol, in regard, that (as Cunlberuh. t.
informs us) divers learned men would have fulphur to be nothing but a mixture,

made in the bowels of the earth, of vitriolate fpirits and a certain combuftible fubllance
: but the quantity of fulphur we obtained by digeftion was much too great
tO have been latent in the oil of vitriol. And that vitriolate fpirits are not neceflary
to the conftru&ion of fuch a fulphur as ours, I could eafily manifeft, if I would'
acquaint you wirh the feveral ways, by which I have obtained, though not in ftach
plenty, a fulphur of antimony, coloured and combuftible like common brimftone.

And though I am not now minded to difcover them, yet I (hall tell you, that «*•
fatisfy fome ingenious men, that diftilled vitriolate fpirits are not ncceflary to the obtaining
of fuch a fulphur as we have been confidering, I did by the bare diftilJation'
of only fpirit of nitre, from its weight of crude antimony, feparate, in a fhort time,
a yellow and very inflammable fulphur -, which, for aught I know, deferves as much
the name of an element, as any thing, that chymifts arc wont to feparate from any
mineral by the fire. I could perhaps tell you of other operations upon antimony,
whereby that may be extracted from it, which cannot be forced out of it by the fire ;
but I fhall refervc them for a fitter opportunity, and only annex at prefent this flight
but not impertinent experiment : that whereas I lately obferved to you, that the urinous
and common falts, whereof falarmoniac confifts, remained unfeVercd by the fire
in many fucceffive fublimations, they may be cafily fcparated, and partly without any
fire at all, by pouring upon the concrete finely powdered, a folution of fait of tartar,
or of the fait of wood-aflies : for upon your diligently mixing of thefe, you will;
find your nofe invaded with a very ftrong fmell of urine, and perhaps too your eyesforced
to water, by the fame lubtile and piercing body, that produces the ftink ; both
thclc effects proceeding from hence, that by the alcab'zate fait, the fca fait, that entered
the compofuion of the fal armoniac, is mortified and made more fixt, and
thereby a divorce is made between it and the volatile urinous fait •, which being at
once fct at liberty, and put into motion, begins prefently to fly away, and to offend
the noflrils and eyes it meets with by the way. And if the operation of thefe falts
be in convenient glafles promoted by warmth, though but by that of a bath, the afcending
(learns may eafily be caught and reduced into a penetrant fpirit, abounding"
with a fait, which I have fometimes found to be fcparable in a crystalline form. I
might add to thefe inflances, that whereas lublirnate, confiding, as you know, of
falts and quickfilver combined and carried up together by heat, may be fublimcdr
I know not how often, by a like degree of fire, without fuffering any divorce of thecomponent
bodies, the mercury may be eafily fevered from the adhering falts, if the
fiiblimate be diddled from fait of tartar, quick lime, or fuch alkalizatc bodies. But
I will rather obferve to you, Eleutbtrius^ what divers ingenious men have thought
fomewhat ftrangc •, that by fuch an additament, that feems but only to promote the
fcparation, there may be eafily obtained from a concrete, that by the fire alone is
eafily divifiblc into all the elements, that vegetables are fuppofed to confift of, Inch
a fimilar fubflance, as diflers in many refpects from them all, and confequently has
by many of the moll intelligent chymifts been denied to be contained in the mixt

the addition of any thing, that is not perfectly a mineral, except falt-petre, may
by one d ill ill at ion in an carthcrn retort be made to afford good ftore of real fait
readily uiffoluble in water \ which 1 found to be neither acid, nor of the fincll of
tartar, and to be almoft as volatile as fpirit of wine itfelf, and to be indeed of l'o differing
a nature from all, that is wont to be feparated by fire from tartar ; that divers
learned men, with whom 1 difcourfed of it, could hardly be brought to believe, that
fo fugitive a fait could be afforded by tartar, till I aflured it tliem upon my own

new textures, and thereby produces concretes of a new indeed, but yet of a compound
nature. This argument it will be requifite for me to profeeute fo fully hereafter,
that I hope you will then confefs, that it is not for want of good proofs, thai
I defire leave to fufpend my proofs, till the feries of my difcourfc mall make it more
proper and fcafonable to propofe them.
It may be further alleged on the behalf of my firft confideration, that fome fuch
diftind fubftances may be obtained from fome concretes without fire, as deferve no
lefs the name of elementary, than many, that chymifts extort by the violence of the
fire.
We fie, that the inflammable fpirit, or, as the chymifts efteem it, the fulphur of
wine, may not only be feparated from it by the gentle heat of a bath, but may be
diftilled either by the help of the fun-beams, or even of a dunghill, being indeed of
fo fugitive a nature, that it isnoteafy to keep it from flying away, even without the
application of external heat. I have likewife obferved, that a veflcl full of urine
being placed in a dunghill, the putrefaction is wont, after fome weeks, fb to open
the body, that the parts difbanding the faline fpirit, will within no very long time, if
the vefiel be not flopped, fly away of Melf ; infomuch, that from fuch urine I have
been able to diftil little or nothing elfe than a naufeous phlegm, inftcad of the active
and piercing fait and fpirit, that it would have afforded, when firft cxpoled to the
fire, if the veflcl had been carefully flopped.
And this leads me to confider, in the fifth place, that it will be very hard to prove,
that there can no other body or way be given, which will, as well as the fire, divide
concretes into feveral homogeneous fubftances, which may confequently be called
their elements or principles, as well as thole feparated or produced by the fire. For
fince we have lately fecn, that nature can fuccefsfully employ other inftruments than
the fire to feparate diftincl fubftances from mixed bodies, how know we, but that nature
has made, or art may make, fome fuch fubftancc, as may be a fit inftrumertt to
analyze mixt bodies, or that fome fuch method may be found by human induftry or
luck, by whofe means compound bodies may be refolved into other fubftances, than
fiich as they are wont to be divided into by the fire ? And why the products of fuch
an analyfis may not as juftly be called the component principles of the bodies, that
afford them, it will not be caly to flicw ; especially fince I fhall hereafter make it evident,
that the fubftances, which chymifts are wont to call the falts, and fulphurs, and
mercuries of bodies, are not fo pure and elementary as they prelume, and as their
hypothefis requires. And this may therefore be the more freely preflcd upon the
chymifts, becaufe neither the Paracellians, nor the Helmontians, can reject it without
apparent injury to their rcl'pcdivc mailers. For Helmont does more than once
inform his readers, that both Paracelfus and himfejf were poffcflbrs of the famous li*
uor, alkaheft, which for its great power in refolving bodies irrefoluble by vulgar
res, he fouicwherc feems to call Ignis Gehenna. To this liquor he afcribes (and that
in great part upon his own experience) fuch wonders, that if we luppoic them all true,
I am fo much the more a friend to knowledge than to wealth, that I fliould think
the alkaheft a nobler and more delirable fecrct, than the philolbphcrs ftone itfclf. Of
this univerfal dillblvent>ic relates, that luving digefted with it for a competent tima
a piece of oaken charcoal, it was thereby reduced into a couple of new and difiind
liquors, diicriminated from each other by their colour and fttuation, and that the
whole body of the coal was reduced into thole liquors, both of ihem fcparable from
his immortal menftruum, which remained as tit lor fuch operations as before. And
lie moreover tells us in divers places of his writings, that by his powerful, and unwearied

wearied agent, be could diflblve metals, marchafues, ftonex, vegetable and animal
bodies of what kind foevcr, and even glafs itfclf (fir It reduced to powder) and in a
word, all kind of mixt bodies in the world, into their feveral fimiiar fubftances
without any refldence or caput acrtuum. Aod laitly, we may gather this further from
his informations, that the homogeneous fubftances obtainable from compound bodies
by his piercing liquor, were oftentimes different enough both as to number and as to
nature, from thole into which the fame bodies are wont to be divided by common fire.
Of which I wall need in this place to mention no other proof, than that whereas we
know, that in our common analyfis of a mixt body, there remains a terreftriaJ and
very fixed fubftance, oftentimes afibciated with a fait as fixed j our author tells us,
that by his way he could diftil over all concretes without any caput mcrtuum, and coivfcquently
could make thofe parts of the concrete volatile, which in the vulgar analyfis
would have been fixt. So that if our chymifts will not rejed the lblemn and
repeated teftimony of a perfon, who cannot but be acknowledged for one of the
ereateft fpagyrifts, that they can boaft of, they muft not deny, that there is to be
found in nature another agent able to analyze compound bodies lcls violently, and
both more genuinely and more univerfally than the fire. And for my own part;
though I cannot but fay on this occafion what (you know) our friend Mt. Boyle is
wont to fay, when he is afked his opinion of any ftrange experiment, Tkat be, (bat
bath feen it, bath more reafon to believe it, than be that bath tut , yet I have found
Helmont fo faithful a writer, even in divers of bis improbable experiments (I always
except that extravagant treatifc De Mcgnettca Vulnerum Curatione, which fomc of his
friends affirm to have been firlt publifhed by his enemies) that I think it fomcwhat
harfh to give him the lye, efpecialh/ to what he delivers upon his own proper tria).
And I have heard from very credible eyc-witneftcs fomc things, and feen fome others
myfelf, which argue fo ftrongly, that a circulated fait, or a menltruum (fuch as it
may be) may, by being abftrafted from compound bodies, whether mineral, animal,
or vegetable, leave them more unlocked than a wary naturalift would eafily believe
that I dare not confidently meafure the power of nature and art by that of the menftruums,
and other inflrumcnts that eminent chymifts themftlves are as yet wont to
employ about the analyzing of bodies-, nor deny, that a menftruum may at leaft
from this or that particular concrete obtain fome apparently fimiiar fubftance, differing
from any obtainable from the fame body by any degree or manner of application of
the fire. And I am the more backward to deny peremptorily, that there may be
fuch openers of compound bodies, becaufe among the experiments, that make me
fpeak thus warily, there wanted not fome, in which it appeared not, that one of the
fubftances, not feparable by common fires and menftruums, could retain any tiling
of the fait, by which the feparation was made.
And here, Eleutberius (fays Carneades) I fhould conclude as much of my difcourfe
as belongs to the firft confidcration I propofed, but that I forcfee, that what I have
delivered will appear liable to two fuch ipecious objections, that I cannot fafcly proceed
any further, till I have examined them.
And firft, one fort of oppofers will be forward to tell me, that they do not pretend
by fire alone to feparate out of all compound bodies their hypoftatical principles
•, it being fufficient, that the fire divides them into fuch, though afterwards they
employ other bodies to colledt the fimiiar parts of the compound ; as it is known,
that though they make ufe of water, to colledt the falinc parts of afhes from the tcrreftrial,
wherewith they are blended, yet it is the fire only, that incinerates bodies, and
reduced the fix«d part of them into the fait and earth, whereof afhes are made up.

This objection is not, I confefs, inconfiderable, and I might in great part allow of it,
without granting it to make againft mc, if 1 would content myfelf to anfwer, that it
is not againft thofe, chat make it, that I have been difputing, but againft thofe
Tulgar chymifts, who themfelves believe, and would fain make others do fo, that
the fire is not only an univcrfal, but an adequate and fufficicnt inftrument to analyze
mixt bodies with. For as to their practice of extracting the fixed fait out of aJhes
by the affufion of water, it is obvious to allege, that the water does only aflcmble together
the fait the fire had before divided from the earth : as a fieve does not further
break the corn, but only bring together into two diftinct heaps the flower and the bran,
whofe corpufcles before lay promifcuoufly blended together in the meal. This I fay
I might allege, and thereby exempt myielf from the need of taking any farther notice
of the propofed objection. Uut not to Lle*the rife it may afford me of illuftrating
the matter under confidcration, 1 am contei.t briefly to confider it, as far forth as my
prefent difquifition may be concerned in it.
Not to repeat then what has been already anfwered, X fay further, that though I
am fo civil an adverfary, that I will allow the chymifts, after the fire has done all its
work, the ufe of fair water to make their extractions with, in fuch cafes wherein thewater
does not co-operate with the fire to make the analyfis \ Vet fince I grant this buf
upon fuppofition, that the water does only wafh off* the faline particles, which the
fire alone has before extricated in the analyzed body, it will not be reafonable, that
this conceflion fhould extend to other liquors, that may add to what they diffolve,
nor fo much as to other cafes than thofe newly mentioned : which limitation I defire
you would be pkafed to bear in mind, till I Hull anon have occafion to make ufe of
it. And this being thus premifed, I (hall proceed to obferve,
First, that miany of the inftances I propofed in the preceding difcourfe are fuch,
that the objection we are confidering will not at all reach them. For fiie can
no more with the afliftance of water, than without it, feparate any of the three
principles, cither from gold, fllrer, mercury, or fome other of the concretes named
above.
Hence we may infer, that fire is not an univerfal analyzer of all mixt bodies,
fince of metals and minerals, wherein chymifts have moll c::ercifed themfelves,
there appear fcarce any, which they are able to analyze by fire, nay, from which they
can unqueftionably feparate lb much as any one of their hypottatical principles •, which
may well appear no lmall difparagement, as well to their hypovhefis, as to their pretentions.
It will alfo remain true, notwithftanding the objection, that there may be other
ways, than the wonted analyfis by fire, to feparate from a compound body fubftanccs
as homogeneous as thofe, that chymifts fcruple not to reckon among their tria prima^
(as fome of them, for brevity fake, call their three principles.)
And it appears, that by convenient additaments fuch fubftances may be feparatcd
by the help of the fire, as could not be fo by the fire alone : witnefs die fuiphur of
antimony.
And laftly, I muft reprefent, that fince it appears too, that the fire is but one of
the iuftruments, that muft be employed in the resolution of bodies, we may reafonably
challenge the liberty of doing two things. For whenever any menftruum or other
fidditament is employed, together with the fire, to obtain a fuiphur or a fait from a
body, we may well take the freedom to examine, whether or no that menftruum do
barely help to feparate the principle obtained by ir, or whether there intervene not acoalition
of the parts of the body wrought upon with thofe of the mciifiruum,

•whereby the produced concrete may be judged to refult from the union of both.
And it will be farther allowable for us to confider, how far any fubftance, feparated
by the help of fuch additaments, ought to pals for one of the tria prima fincc by
one way or handling the fame mixt body, it may, according to the nature of the additaments,
and the method of working upon it, be made to afford differing fubftances
from it by other additaments, and another method, nay and (as may appear
by what I formerly told you about tartar) differing from any of the fubftances, into
which a concrete is divifible by the fire without additaments, though, perhaps, thole
additaments do not, as ingredients, enter the compofition of the obtained body, but
only diverfify the operation of the fire upon the concrete •, and though that concrete
by the fire alone may be divided into a.number of differing fubftances, as great as
any of the chymifts, that I have met with, teach us that of the elements to be. And
having faid thus much (fays Carneades) to the objection likely to be propofed by fomc
chymifts, I am now to examine that, which I forefee will be conhdendy preffed by
divers Peripatetics, who, to prove fire to be the true analyzer of bodies, will plead,
That it is the very definition of heat given by sfriJlo:!et and generally received, congregare
bomcgenta^ &figregare betercgenea^ * to alTcmble things of a refembling, and
' disjoin thole of a differing nature.' To this I anfwer, that this effect is far from
being lb effemial to heat, as it is generally imagined ; for it rather feems, that the true
and genuine property of heat is, to let a moving, and thereby to diffociate the parts
of bodies, and lubdivide them into minute particles, without regard to their being
homogeneous or heterogeneous ; as is apparent in the boiling or water, the diftillation
of quickfilver, or the expofing of bodies to the action of the fire, whofe parts
either are not (at leaft in that degree of heat appear not) diflimilar, where, all that
the fire can do, is to divide the body into very minute parts, which are of the fame
nature with one another, and with their totum, as their reduction by condenfation
evinces. And even when the fire feems moft fo congregate bomogenea, 6? fegregare beterogenea
y it produces that effect but by accident j for the fire does but diffolve the
cement, or rather matter the frame, or ftru&ure, that kept the heterogeneous parts
of bodies together, under the common form j upon which diffolution the component
particles of the mixt, being freed and fet at liberty, do naturally, and oftentimes
without any operation of the fire, affociate themfclvcs each with its like, or rather
do take thofe places, which their fcveral degrees of gravity and levity, fixednefs or
volatility (either natural, or adventitious from the impreffion of the fire) aflign them.
Thus in the diftillation (for inftance) of man's blood, the fire does firft begin to
diffolve the nexus or cement of the body •, and then the water, being the molt volatile,
and eafy to be extracted, is cither by the igneous atoms, or the agitation they are
put into by the fire, firft carried up, till forfaken by what carried it up, its weight
finks it down, into the receiver : but all this while the other principles or the concrete
remain unfevered, and require a ftronger degree of heat to make a feparation of its
more fixt elements; and therefore the fire muft be increafed, which carries over the
volatile fait and theJpirit, they being, though believed to be differing principles, and
though really of different confiftency, yet of an almoft equal volatility. After them,
as lels fugitive, comes over the oil, and leaves behind the earth and the alcali, which
being of an equal fixednefs, the fire fevers them not, for all the definition of the
fchools. And if into a red-hot earthen or iron retort you caft the matter to be diftilled,
you may obferve, as I have often done, that the predominant fire will carry
Bp all the volatile elements confufedly in one fume, which will afterwards take their
places in the receiver, either according to the degree of their gravity, or according

to the exigency of their refpective textures j the fait adhering, for the moft part, to
the (ides and top, and the phlegm fattening itfelf there too in great drops, the oil
and fpirit placing themfelves under, or above one another, according as their ponderouinefs
makes them fwim or fink. For it is obfcrvable, that though oil or liquid
fulphur be one of the elements feparated by this fiery ana ly lis, yet the heat, which
accidentally unites the particles of the other volatile principles, has not always the
fame operation on this, there being divers bodies, which yield two oils, whereof the
one finks to the bottom of that fpirit, on which the other fwims •, as I can (hew you
in fome oils of the fame deer's blood, which arc yet by me : nay, I can Ihew you two
oils carefully made of the fame parcel of human blood, which not only differ extremely
in colour, but fwim upon one another without mixture, and, if by agitation
confounded, will of themfelves divorce again.
And that the fire doth oftentimes divide bodies, upon the account, that fome of
their parts are more fixt, and fome more volatile, how far foever either of thefe two
may be from a pure elementary nature, is obvious enough, if men would but heed
it in the burning of wood, which the fire diflipates into fmoke and afties : for not only
the latter of thefe is confeffedly made up of two fuch differing bodies as earth and
kit j but the former being condenfed into that foot, which adheres to our chimneys,
difcovcrs itfelf to contain both fait and oil, and fpirit and earth (and fome portion of
phlegm too) which being, all almoft, equally volatile to that degree of fire, which
forces them up, (the more volatile parts helping, perhaps, as well as the urgency
of the fire, to carry up the more fixt ones, as I have otten tried in dulcified colcothar,
fublimed by fal armoniac blended with it) are carried up together, but may
afterwards be feparated by other degrees of fire, whofe orderly gradation allows the
difparity of their volatilencls to difcover itfelf. Befides, if differing bodies united
into one mafs be both fufficiently fixt, the fire finding no parts volatile enough to be
expelled or carried up, makes no feparation at all •, as may appear by a mixture of
coUiquatcd filver and gold, whofe component metals may be eafily fever'd by aqua
fortis or aqua regis (according to the predominancy of the filver and gold) but in
the fire alone, though vehement, the metals remain unfeverM, the fire only dividing
the body into fmaller particles (whofe littlenefs may be argued from their fluidity) in
which either the little nimble atoms of fire, or its brifk and numberlel> ftrokes upon the
veflels, hinder reft and continuity, without any fequeftration of elementary principles.
Moreover, the fire fometimes does not feparate, fo much as unite, bodies of a differing
nature ; provided they be of an almoft refemhling fixednefs, and have in the figure
of their parts an aptnel's to coalition, as we fee in the making of many plaifters, ointments,
cVf. And in fuch metalline mixtures as that made by melting together two
parts of clean brafs with one of pure copper, of which fome ingenious tradefmen
caft fuch curious patterns (for gold and filver works) as I have fometimes taken great
pleafure to look upon. Sometimes the bodies mingled by die fire are differing
enough as to fixidity and volatility, and" yet are lo combined by the firft operation
of the fire, that iticlf does fcarce afterwards feparate them, but only pulverize
them ; whereof an inftancc is afforded us by the common preparation of mercurius
dulcis, where the falinc particles of the vitriol, fea-falt, and fometimes nitre, employed
to make the fubhmacc, do fo unite themfelves with the mercurial particles
made ufc of, firlt to make lublimate, and then to dulcify it, that the falinc and metalline
parts arife together in many fuccefiive fublimations, as if they all made but
one body. And fometimes too, the fire does not only not lever the differing elements
of a body, but combine them fo firmly, that nature hcrfelf does very fcldom, if

ever, make unions lefs diflblublc. For the fire meeting with fome bodies exceedingly
and almoft equally fixt, inftead of making a separation, makes an union fo ftriel,
that itfclf, alone, is unable to diffolve it) as we lee, when an alcalizate fait and the
tcrrcftrial refiduc of the afhes are incorporated with pure land, and by vitrification
made one permanent body, (I mean the coarfe or greenilh fort of glafs) that mocks
the greateft violence of the fire, which though able to marry the ingredients of k,
yet is not able to divorce them. I can (hew you fome pieces of glafs, which I faw
flow down from an earthen crucible purpofely expoied for a good while, with Giver
in it, to a very vehement fire. And fome that deal much in the fufion of metals
inform me, that the melting of a great part of a crucible into glafs is no great
wonder in their furnaces. I remember, I have obferved too in the melting of great
quantities of iron out of the ore, by the help of ftore of charcoal (for they affirm
that fca-coal will not yield a flame ftrong enough) that by the prodigious vehemence
of the fire, excited by vail bellows (made to play by great wheels turned about by
water) part of the materials cxpofed to it, was, inftead of being analized, colliquated,
and turned into a dark, fdtid, and very ponderous glafs, and that in fuch quantity,
that in fome places I have fcen the very high-ways, near fuch iron-works, mended
with heaps of fuch lumps of glals, inftead of ftones and gravel. And I have alio
obferved, that fome kind of fire-ftone itfclf, having been employed in furnaces
wherein it was expofed to very ftrong and lafting fires, has had all its fixed parts fo
wrought on by the fire, as to be perfectly vitrified, which I have tried by forcing
from it pretty large pieces of perfect and tranfparent glafs. And left you might
think Elcutbcrius, that the qucftioned definition of heat may be demo nil rated, by
the definition, which is wont to be given and acquiefced in, of its contrary quality,
cold ; whofe property is taught to be tarn bomogaua, qttam btterogenea congregare* give
me leave to rcprelcnt to you, that neither is this definition unqueftionable j for not
to mention the exceptions, which a logician, as fuch, may take at it, I confider,
that the union of heterogeneous bodies, which is fuppofed to be the genuine production
of cold, is not performed by every degree of cold. For we fee, for inftance,
(hat in the urine of healthy men, when the liquor has been fuffered a while to ftand,
the cold makes a feparation of the thinner part from the grofTer, which fubfides to the
bottom, and grows opacous there i whereas, if the urinal be warm, thefe parts readily
mingle again, and the whole liquor becomes tranfparent as before. And when, by
glaciation, wood, ftraw, duft, water, £srV. are fuppofed to be united into one lump
of ice, the cold does not caufc any real union or adonation (if I may fo fpeak) of
thefe bodies, but only hardening the aqueous parts of the liquor into ice, the other
bodies, being accidentally prefent in that liquor, are frozen up in it, but not really
united. And accordingly, if we expofe a heap of money, confuting of gold, filver
and copper coins, or any other bodies of differing natures, which are deftitute of
aqueous moifture, capable of congelation, to never fo intenfe a cold, we find not,,
that thefe differing bodies arc at all thereby To much as compared, much lefs united
together ; and even in liquors themfelves we find phenomena, which induce us to
quefbon the definition, which we are examining. If Paracelfus his authority were to
be looked upon as a fufficicnt proof in matters of this nature, 1 might here infift on
that procefs of his, whereby he ceachts, that the effence of wine may be fever'd from
the phlegm and ignoble part by the affiftance of congelation. And becaufc much
weight has been laid upon this procefs, not only by Paracclfians, but other writers,
fome of whomfcem not to have perilled it themfelves, I fliall give you the intirepaffage
in the author's own words, as I lately found them in the fixth book of his

But I dare not, Ekutberius, lay much weight upon diis procefs, becaufe I have
have found, that, if it were true, it would be but feldom practicable in this country
upon the beft wine : for though this prefent winter hath been extraordinary cold, yet
in very keen frofts, accompanied with lading mows, I have not been able in any
meafure to freeze a thin phial full of fack ; and even with fnow and fait I could freeze
little more than the furface of it ; and I fuppofe, Eleutberius, that it is not every degree
of cold that is capable of congealing liquors, which is able to make fuch an
analyfu (if I may fo call it) of them by feparating their aqueous and fpirituous
parts : for I have fometimes, though not often, frozen feverally red-wine, urine and
milk, but could not obferve the expected reparation. And the Dutchmen, that
were forced to winter in that icy region near the arctick circle, called Nova Zembla,
although they relate, as we fholl fee below, that there was a feparation of parts made
in their frozen beer about the middle of November, yet of the freezing of their fack
in December following they give but this account : Tea and our fack, vobicb is fo hot,
was frozen very bard, fo that when we were every man to have bis part, we were forced
to melt it in the fire ; wbicb we fhared every fecond day, about half a pint for a man,
wherewith we were forced to fuftain ourfehes. In which words they imply not, that
their fack was divided by the froft into differing fubftances, after fuch manner as their
beer had been. AH which notwithstanding, Eleutberius, fuppoie that it may be
made to appear, that even cold fometimes may congregare bomcgenea, is beterogeneit
fegregare ; and to manifeft this, I may tell you, that I did once, purpofcly, caufc to
be decocted in fair water a plant abounding with fulphureous and fpirituous pans
;
and having expofed the decoction to a keen North-wind in a very frofty night, I
obferved, that the more aqueous parts of it were turned by the next morning into
ice, towards the innermoft part of which, the more agile and fpirituous parts, as I
then conjectured, having retreated, to fhun, as much as might be, their invironing
enemy, they had there prelerved themfelvcs unfrozen in the form of a high coloured
liquor; the aqueous and fpirituous parts having been fo flightry (blended rather
than) united in the decoction, that they were eafily fcparable by fuch a degree of
cold, as would not have been able to have divorced the parts of urine or wine,
which by fermentation or digeftion are wort, as trial has informed me, to be more
intimately affociatcd each widi other. But I have already intimated, Ekutberius,
that I fhall not inlift on this experiment, not only becaufe, having made it but once,
I may poflibly have been miftaken in it; but alio (and that principally) bceauie
of that much more full and eminent experiment of the feparative virtue of extreme
cold, that was made againft their wills, by the formentioned Dutchmen that wintered
in Nova Zembla ; the relation of whofe voyage being a very fcarcc book, it will not

that we were forced to go into the (hip again, becaufe we were not able to (lay

And on this occafion I remember, that having, the laft very (harp winter, purpofely
tried to freeze, among other liquors, fome beer moderately ftrong, in glafs
veffcls, with fnow and fak, 1 obferved, that there came out of the neck a certain
thick fubftance, which, k fcems, was much better able than the reft of the liquor
(that I found turned into ice) to refill a troll ; and which, by its colour and confidence,
feemed manifeftly enough to be yeaft •, whereat, I confefs, I fomewhat marvelled,
becaufe I did not either difcern by the tafte, or find by enquiry, that the beer
was at all too new, to be very fit to be drank. I might confirm the Dutchmen's
relation, by what happened a while fince to a near friend of mine, who complained
to me, that having brewed fome beer or ale for his own drinking in Holland (where
he then dwelt) the keennefs of the late bitter winter froze the drink, fo as to reduce
it into ice, and a fmall proportion of a very ftrong and fpirituous liquor. Buc I muft
not entertain you any longer concerning cold, not only becaufe you may think I have

yet fince I undertook but to make the common aflumption of our Chymifts and Aristotelians
appear queftionable, I hope I have fo performed that tafk, that I may now
proceed to my following confiderations, and infift lefs on them than I have done oa

SCEPTICAL CHYMIST:
PART II.
THE fecond confederation I define to have notice taken of, is this •, that it is
not fo fure, as both Chymifts and Ariftotelians are wont to think it, that every
fecmingly fimilar or diftinft fubftance, that is feparated from a body by the help of
the fire, was pre cxiftent in it, as a principle or element of it.
That I may not make this paradox a greater than needs muft, I will firft briefly
explain what the propofition means, before I proceed to argue for it.
And, I fuppole, you will c a lily believe, that I do not mean, that any thing is
feparable from a body by fire, that was not materially pre-exiftent in it : for ic
far exceeds the power of meerly natural agents, and confequently of the fire, to produce
anew fo much as one atom of matter, which they can but modify and alter,
not create which is fo obvious a truth, that almoft all feds of philofophers have
denied the power of producing matter to fecond caufes, and the Epicureans and
fomc others have done the like, in reference to their gods themfclves.
Nor does the propofition peremptorily deny, but that fome things obtained by the
fire from a mixed body may have been more than barely materially pre-exiftent in
it | fince there are concretes, which before they be expofed to the fire, afford us
fcveral documents of their abounding, fome with fait, and others with fulphur. For
it will ferve the prefent turn, if it appear, that divers things obtained from a mixed
body expofed to the fire were not its ingredients before ; for, if this be made to
appear, it will be rational enough to fufpeft, that chymifts may deceive themfclves,
and others, in concluding refolutely and univerfally, thofe fubftances to be the elementary
ingredients of bodies barely feparated by the fire, of which it yet may be doubted,
whether there be fuch or no* at leaft till fome other argument, than that drawn from
the analyfis, be brought to refolve die doubt.
That then, which I mean by the propofition I am explaining, is, that it may
without abfurdity be doubted, whether or no the differing fubftances obtainable from
a concrete diffipatcd by the fire were fo exiftent in it, in that form (at leaft, as to
their minute parts) wherein we find them, when the analyfis is over, that the fire did
only disjoin and extricate the corpuicles of one principle from thole of the other,
wherewith before they were blended.
Having thus explained my propofition, I fhall endeavour to do two things, to
prove it •, the firft of which is to fhew, that fuch fubftances, as chymifts call principles,
may be produced de novo (as they fpeak.) And the other is to make it probable,
that by the fire \vc may actually obtain from fomc mixed bodies fuch fubftances,
as were not, in the newly-expounded fenfe, pre-exiftent in them.
To begin then with the firft of thefe, 1 confidcr, that if it be as true, as it is
probable, that compounded bodies differ from one another but in the various texture!

tures refulting from the bigncfs, lhape, motion, and contrivance of their fmall parts,
it will not be irrational to conceive, that one and the fame parcel of the umverfal
matter may, by various alterations and contextures, be brought to deferve the name,
fometimes of fulphureous, and fomctimes of a terrene, or aqueous body. And this
I could more largely explicate, but that our friend Mr. Beyle has promifed us fomcthing
about qualities, wherein the theme I now willingly relign him, will, I qucftion
not, be ftudioufly inquired into. Wherefore, what 1 lhall now advance in favour
of what I have lately delivered, ftiall be deduced from experiments made divers
years fince. The firft of which would have been much more confiderable, but that
by fome intervening accidents I was neceflitated to lofe ihe beft time of the year,
for a trial of the nature of that I defigned ; it being about the middle of May,
before I was able to begin an experiment, which mould have then been two months
old •, but fuch as it was, it will not, perhaps, be impertinent to give you this narrative
of it. At the time newly mentioned, I caufed my gardener (being by urgent
occaGons hindered from being prefent myfclf ) to dig out a convenient quantity of
good earth, and dry it well in an oven, to weigh it, to put in an earthen pot almoft
level with the furface of the ground, and to fet in it a feledted feed, he had before
received from me, for that purpofe, of fquafti, which is an Indian kind of pompion,
that grows apace ; this feed I ordered bim to water only with rain or fpring water.
I did not (when my occafions permitted me to vifit it) without delight behold how
faft it grew, though unfeafonably fawn •, but the haftening winter hindered it from
attaining any thing near its due and wonted magnitude, (for I found the fame autumn,
in my garden, fome of thofe plants, by meafure, as big about as my middle) and
made mc order the having it taken up ; which about the middle of Oelober was carefully
done by the fame gardener, who a while after lent me this account of it : /
have weighed the pompion with the ftalk and leaves, all which weighed three pound wanting
a quarter j then I took the earth, baked it as formerly, andfound itjujl as much as I
did at firft, which made me think, I bad net dried it fujicientfy. Then I put it into the
even twice mere, after the bread was drawn, and weighed it the feeond time, but fcund it
fhrink little or nothing.
But to deal candidly with you, Eleutherius, I muft not conceal from you the event
of another experiment of this kind made this prefent i'ummer, wherein the earth
feems to have been much more wafted \ as may appear by the following account, lately
fent me by the fame gardener, in thefe words: To give yen an account of your cucumbers,
I have gained two indifferent fair cms, the weight of them is ten pound and a half,
the branches with the roots weighed four pounds wanting two ounces ; and when J bad
weighed them, I tcok the earth, and baked it in feveral fmall earthen difhes in an oven j
and when I bad fo done, I fcund the earth wanted a pound and a half of v hat it was
formerly ; yet I was not fatisfied, doubting the earth was not dry • J put it into an oven
the fecond time, (after the bread was drawn) and after I had taken it out and weighed
it, I found it to be the fame weight. So J fuppcfe there was no moifture left in the
earth. Neither do I think, that the pcttrtd and half, that was wanting, was drawn
away by the cucumber, but a great part of it, in the order ng, was in duft (and the Itke
)
wafted: (the cucumbers are kept by themfehes, left you fhould fend for them.) But yet
in dns trial, Eleutherius, it appears, that though fome of the earth, or rather the
diflbluble fait harboured in it, were wafted, the main body of' the plant confined of
tranfmuted water. And 1 might add, that a year after 1 caufed the formerly mentioned
experiment, touching large pompions, to be reiterated, with fo good luccefs,
that ifmy memory does noi much mif-inform me, it did not only much lurpafs any, thac

I made before, but feemed ftrangely to conclude what I am pleading for ; though
(by reafon, 1 hare unhappily loft the particular account my gardener writ me up of
the circumftances) I dare not infill upon them. The like experiment may be as conrenienth/
tried with the feeds of any plant, whofe growth is hafty, and its Gze bulky.
If tobacco will in thefe cold climates grow well in earth undunged, it would not be
ami6 to make a trial with it ; for it is an annual plant, that ariles where it profpers,
fometimes as high as a tall man, and 1 have had leaves of it in my garden, near a
foot and a half broad. But the neat time I try this experiment, it fhall be with
fereral feeds of the fame fort, in the fame pot of earth, that fo the event may be the
more confpicuous. Bur, becaufe every body iias not conveniency of time and place
for this experiment neither, I made, in my chamber, feme (hotter and more expeditious
trials^ I took a top of fpearment, about hci inch long, and put it into a good
phial full of foring water, fo as the upper part of the mint was above the neck of the
glafs, and the lower part immerfed in the water » within a few days this mint began
to moot forth roots into the water, and to diiplay its leaves, and afoire upwards ; and
in a feort time it had numerous roots and leaves, and thefe very ftrong and fragrant
of the odour of the mint •, but the heat of my chamber, as 1 fuppofe, killed the plant,
when it was grown to have a pretty thick ftalk, which with the various and ramified
roots, which it fttot into the water as if it had been earth, prefented' in its tranfparent
flower-pot a fpeftaele not unpleafant to behold. The like I tried with fwcet-marjoram
; and I found the experiment fucceeded alio, though fomewhat more (lowly,
with balm and peniroyal, to name now no other plants. And one of thefe vegetables,
cherilhed only by water, having obtained a competent growth, I did, for trial's fake,
cavfe to be diftillcd in a fmall retort, and thereby obtained fome phlegm, a little
empyreumatical fpirit, a fmall quantity of aduft aiL and a caput mcrtuum •, which appearing
to be a coal, I concluded it to confift of fait and earth : but the quantity
of it was fo fmall, that I forbore to calcine it. The water I ufed to n»urifli this
plant was not fhifted nor renewed ; and I chofe fpring-watcr rather than rain-water,
becaufe the latter is more difcernably a kind of is-axnrf^uue, which, though it be
granted to be freed from groffer mixtures, fcems yet to contain in it, befides the
Reams of feveral bodies wandering in the air, which may be fuppoied to impregnate
it, a certain fpirituous fubftance, which may be extracted out ot it, and is by fome
miftaken for the fpirit of the world corporiiied, upon what grounds, and with what
probability, I may clfewhcre, perchance, but mult not now, ditcourfe to you.
But perhaps I might have faved a great part of my labour. For I find, that
Hchnont (an author more confiderable for his experiments, than many learned men are
pleafed to think him) having had an opportunity to profecure an experiment much of
the fame nature with thole I have been now fpeaking of, for rive years together,
obtained at the end of that time fo notable a quantity of tranlmutcd water, that I
Jhould fcarce think it fit to have his experiment, and mine mentioned together, were
it not, that the length of time requifite to this may deter the curiofity of fome, and
exceed the leifure of others ; and partly, that fo paradoxical a truth, as that, whicli
thefe experiments fcem to hold forth, needs to be confirmed by more witnefles than
one, cfpecially fince the extravagancies and untruths, to be met with in Flelmont's
trcatife of the magnetic cure of wounds, have made his tcftimonics lufpe&cd in his
other writings ; though as to fome of the unlikely matters of faft he delivers in than,
I might fafely undertake to be his compurgator. But that experiment of his, which
I was mentioning to you, he fays, was this: he took 200 pound of earth dried in
an oven, and having put it into an earthen velfel, anil moiucned it with rain-water,
496 The Sceptical Chymist.
he planted in it the trunk, of a willow-tree of five pound weight-, this he watered, as
need required, with rain or diftdled water; and to keep the neighbouring earth from
getting into the vcfTcl, he employed a plate of iron tinned over and perforated with
many holes. Five years being effluxed, he took out the tree, and weighed it, and
(with computing the leaves that fell during four autumns) he found it to weigh 169
pound, and about three ounces. And having again dryed the earth it -rew in, he
ibund it to want of its farmer weight of 200 pound, about a couple only ot ounces
fothat 164 pound of the roots, wood, and bark, which conftituted the tree, fcer.i to
have fprung from the water. And though it appears not, that Helmont had the curiofity
to make any analyfis of this plant, yet what I lately told you I did to one of the
vegetables 1 nourifhed with water only, will I fuppofe keep you from doubting, that
if he had diddled this tree, it would have afforded him the like diftinct iubdanccs
as another vegetable of the fame kind. I need not fubjoin, that I had it alfo in my
thoughts to try, how experiments, to the fame purpofc with thofe I related to you,
would fuccced in other bodies than vegetables, becaule importunate avocations having
hitherto hindered me from putting my delign in practice, I can yet fpeak but
conjedturally of the fuccels : but the beft is, that the experiments already made and
mentioned to you need not the affiftance of new ones, to verify as much, as my prefent
tafk makes it concern me to prove by experiments of this nature.
One would fufpect (fays Elcutberius after his long filence) by what you have been
difcourfing, that you are not far from Helmont's opinion about the origination of
compound bodies, and perhaps too diflike not the arguments, which he employs to
prove it.
What Helmontian opinion, and what arguments do you mean? (aflts Carneades.)
What you have been newly difcourfing (replies EUutberius) tells us, that you cannot
but know, that this bold and acute Spagyrilt fcruples not to affert, that all mixt
bodies fpring from one element , and that vegetables, animals, marchafites, Hones,
metals, &c. are materially but fimple water difguifed into thefc various forms, by
the plaftick or formative vertuc of their feeds. And as for his reafons, you may find
divers of them fcattered up and down his writings ; the confiderablcft of which feem
to be thefe three ; the ultimate reduction of mixt bodies into infipid water, the viciffitude
of the fuppofed elements, and the production of perfectly mixt bodies out of
fimple water. And firft he affirms, that the fal circuhtus Paracclfi^ or his liquor
alkaheft, does adequately refolve plant;, animals, and minerals into one liquor or
more, according to dieir feveral internal difparities of parts, (without caput rmyrtuum,
or the deftru&ion of their feminal vermes ;) and that the alkaheft being abftracled
from thefe liquors in the fame weight and virtue wherewith it diffolved them, the
liquors may by freque nt cohobations from chalk or fome other idoneous matter, be
totally deprived of their feminal endowments, and return at laft to their firft matter,
inlipid water : fome other ways he propofes here and there to divert fome particular
bodies of their borrowed fhapes, and make them remigratc to their firft fimplicity.
The fecond topick, whence Helmont draws his arguments, to prove water to be the
material caufe of mixt bodies, I told you was this, tlut the other fuppofed ekmcnts
may be tranfmutcd into one another. But the experiments by him here and there
produced on this occafion are fo uncafy to be made and to be judged of, that I fhall
nor infift on them ; nor to mention, that if they were granted to be true, his infereri'.
c trom them is fomewhat difputable. And therefore I fhall pafs on to tell you,
that as, in his firft argument, our paradoxical author endeavours to prove water the

fome other conquering agent, the feeds have been deftroyed, which difguifed them *
or when by time thofe" feeds are wearied, or exantlated, or unable to act their parts
upon the ftage of the univerle any longer ; fo in his third argument he endeavours to
evince the fame conclufion, by the conftitution of bodies, which he afTerts to be nothing
but water fubdued by feveral virtues. Of this he gives here and there in his
writings feveral inftances, as to plants and animals \ but divers of them being difficult
either to be tried or to be underftood, and others of them being not altogether
unobnoxious to exceptions, I think you have fingled out the principal and Ids
qucftionable experiment, when you lately mentioned that of the willow-tree. And
having thus, continues Eleutberius, to anfwer your queftion, given you a fummary
account of what, I am confident, you know better than I do, I (hall be very glad to
receive yourfenfe of it, if the giving it me will not too much divert you from the profecution
of your difcourfe.
That if (replies Carneades) was not needlefsly annexed : for thoroughly to examine
fuch an hypcthefis and fuch arguments, would require fo many confederations,
and confequently fo much time, that I ihould not now have the leifure to perfect
fuch a digreflion, and much lefs to finifh my principal difcourfe. Yet thus much I
fhall tell you at prefent, that you need not fear my rejecting this opinion for its novelty
, fince, however the Helmontians may, in compliment to their mafter, pretend
it to be a new difcovery, yet though the arguments be for the moll part his, the
opinion itfelf is very antient : for Diogenes Laertius and divers other authors fpeak
of Tholes, as the firft among the Grecians, that made difquifitions upon nature. And aww
of this Tbales, I remember, Tulfy informs us, that he taught all things were at firft
made of water. And it feems by Plutarch and Juftin Martyr, that the opinion was
ancienter than he : for they tell us, that he ufed to defend his tenet by the teftimony
of Homer. And a Greek author, the fcholiaft of Apdlonius, upon thefe words,
'Eg i|3x«Wi »«th.
The earth of flime was made.,
affirms (out of Zeno) that the chaos, whereof all things were made, was, according
to litfioi, water-, which, fettling firft, became flime, and then condenfed into folid
earth. And the fame opinion about the generation of flime fcems to have been entertained
by Orpheus, out. of whom one of the ancients cites this teftimony, Attain*

'Ex t» Zixrfo* tAuf x»Ti'ns.
Of water flime was made.
It fcems alfo by what is delivered in • Strabo out of another author concerning the
Indians, that they likewife held, that all things had differing beginnings, but that, of
which the world was made, was water. And the like opinion has been by feme
of the ancients afcribed to the Phcnicians, from whom Tbales himfclf is conceived
to have borrowed it \ as probably the Greeks did much of theology, and, as 1 am
apt to think, of their philofophy too ; fince the deviling of the atomical hypothefis
commonly afcribed to Leuctppus and his difciple Democritus is by learned men attri-

fo •, for it is known, that the Phenicians borrowed mod of their learning from the
Hebrews. And among thofe, that acknowledge the books of Mofes, many have
been inclined to think water to have been the primitive and univerfal matter, by
perufing the beginning of Cencfis, where the waters feem to be mentioned as the material
caufe, not only of fublunary compound bodies, but of all thofe, that make
up the univcrfe -, whofe component parts did orderly, as it were, emerge out of

be fuppofed, divinely impregnated with the feeds of all things, were by that productive
incubation qualified to produce them. But you, I prefume, expeft, that I
fliould difcourfe of this matter like a naturalift, not a philologcr. Wherefore I mail
add, to countenance Helmont's opinion, that whereas he gives not, that I remember,
any inftance of any mineral body, nor fcarcc of any animal, generated of water, a
French chymift, Monficur de Rocbas, has prcfentcd his readers an experiment, which
if it were punctually fuch as he has delivered it, is very notable. He then difcourfing
of the generation of things according to certain chymical and metaphorical notions
(which I confefs are not to me intelligible) lets down, among divers {peculations not
pertinent to our fubject, the following narrative, which 1 lhaU repeat to you the fenfe
of in Englifh, with as little variation from the literal fenfe of the French words, as
my memory will enable me. Having (lays he) difcernedfucbgreat wonders by tbt natural
operation of water, I would know what may be dam with it by art imitating nature.
Wherefore I took water, wbicb I well knew not to be compounded, nor to be mixed with
any other thing than that fpirit of life (wherepf he had fpoken before) and with a beat
artificial, continual and proportionate, 1 prepared and difpofed it by the above mentioned
graduations of coagulation, congelation, and fixation, until it was turned into earthy
wbicb earth produced animals, vegetables and minerals. I tell not what animals, vegetables
and minerals, for that is referved for another occafion : but the animals did move
of tbemfelves, eat, &c.
—
and by the true anatomy 1 made of them, I found, that they
were compofed of much fulpbur, little mercury, and Itfs fait.—The minerals began to grow
and increafe by converting into their own nature one part of the earth thereunto difpofed;
they were folid and heavy. And by this truly demonjlrative fcience, namely cbymiftry, I
found, that they were compofed of much fait, little fulpbur, and Itfs mercury.
But (fays Carneades) I have fome fufpicions concerning this ftrange relation, which
make mc unwilling to declare an opinion of it, unlefs I were fatisned concerning divers
material circumftanccs, that our author has left unmentioned ; though, as for
the generation cf living creatures, both vegetable and fenfitive, it needs not feem
incredible, fince we find, that our common water (which indeed is often impregnated
with variety of feminal principles and rudiments) being long kept in a quiet place,
will putrify and ftink, and then perhaps too, produce mofs and little worms, or other
inlc&s, according to the nature of the feeds that were lurking in it. I mud likewife
defire you to take notice, that as Helmont gives us no inftance of the production of
minerals out of water, fo the main argument, that he employs to prove, that they
and other bodies n-.ay be refolved into water, is drawn from the operations of his
alkalieft, and confequently cannot be fatisfactorily examined by you and me.
Yet certainly (fays Eleutberius) you cannot but have fomewhat wondered as well
as I, to obfirrve, how great a fliarc of water goes to the making up of divers bodies,

whofe difguifrs promifc nothing near fo much. The diftillation of eels, though it
yielded me fome oil, and fpirit, and volatile fait, befldes the caput mortuum, yet
were all thefe fo difproportionate to the phlegm, that came from them, (and in which
at firft they boiled as in a pot of water) that they feemed to have been nothing but
coagulated phlegm j which does likewife ftrangely abound in vipers, though they are
efteemed very hot in operation, and will in a convenient air iurvive fome days the
lofs of their heads and hearts, lb vigorous is their vivacity. Man's blood itfelf, as
fpirituous and as elaborate a liquor as it is reputed, docs fo abound in phlegm, that,
the other day, diddling fome of it on purpofe to try the experiment (as I had formerly
done in deer's blood) out of about feven ounces and a half of pure blood we
drew near fix ounces of phlegm, before any of the more operative principles began to
arife and invite us to change the receiver. And to fatisfy myfelf, that fome of thefe
animal phlegms were void enough of fpirit to defervc that name, I would not content
myfelf to tafte them only, but fruidefsly poured on them acid liquors, to try if they
contained any volatile fait or fpirit, which (had there been any there) would probably
have difcovered itfelf by making an ebullition with the affufed liquor. And now I
mention corrofive fpirits, I am minded to inform you, that though they fcem to be
nothing elfe but fluid falts, yet they abound in water, as you may obferve, if cither
you entangle, and fo fix their faline part, by making them corrode fome idoneous
body, or clfe if you mortify it with a contrary fait j as I have very manifeftly obferved
in the making a medicine fomewhat like Helmont's Balfamus Samech, with diftilled
vinegar inftead of fpirit of wine, wherewith he prepares it. For you would fcarce
believe (what I have lately obferved) that of that acid fpirit, the fait of tartar, from
whichu is diftilled, will, by mortifying and retaining the acid fait, turn into worthlefs
phlegm near twenty times its weight •, before it be fo fully impregnated as to rob
no more diftilled vinegar of its fait. And though fpirit of wine exquifitely recliBcd,
fcem of all liquors to be the moft free from water, it being fo igneous, that it will
flame all away without leaving the lead drop behind it, yet even this fiery liquor is
by Helmont not improbably affirmed, in cafe what he relates be true, to be materially
water, under a fulphurous difguife : for according to him, in the making that excellent
medicine, Paracelfus his Balfamus Samech, (which is nothing but fal tartari
dulcified, by diftilling from it fpirit of wine till the fait be fufficiently glutted with its
fulphur, and till it l'uffcr the liquor to be drawn of}', as ftrong as it was poured on)
when the fait of tartar from which it is diftilled hath retained, or deprived it of the
fulphurous parts of the fpirit of wine, the reft, which is incomparably the greater
part of the liquor, will rcmigratc into phlegm. I added that claufe [In cafe what
be relates be true] becaufe I have not as yet forficiently tried it myfelf. But not only
fomething of experiment keeps me from thinking it, as many chymilts do, tbAird,
(though I have, as well as they, in vain tried it with ordinary fait of tartar) but
befides that HelmctU often relates it, and draws confequences from it \ a perfon noted
for his fobernels and (kill in fpagyrical preparations, having been afked by me,
whether the experiment might not be made to fucceed, if the fait and fpirit were
prepared, according to a way fuitable to my principles, he affirmed to me, that he
had that way, I propofed, made Helmont's experiment fucceed very well, without
adding any thing to the Lit and fpirit. But our way is neither fliort nor cafy.

reduce all bodies inro water, yet whether that water, becaufe infipid, miift be elementary,
may not groundlefsly be doubted : for I remember the candid and eloquent
l'etrus Lanrewbergius, in his notes upon Sala's aphorifms, affirms, that he faw an in •
f.pLl menftruum, that was a powerful diflblvent, and (if my memory does not much
n.if-inform me) could diflblve gold. And the water, which may be drawn from
quick filvcr without addition, though it be almoft taftelefs, you will, I believe, think
of a differing nature from fimple water, cfpecially if you digeft in it appropriated
minerals. To which I fhall add but this, that this confideration may be further extended.
For 1 lec no ncceffity to conceive, that the water mentioned in the beginning
of GewftSy as the univerl'al matter, was fimple and elementary water ; fince though
we Ihould fuppofc it to have been an agitated congeries or heap confifting of a great
variety of feminal principles and rudiments, and of other corpufcles fit to be fubdued
and fafhioncd by them, it might yet be a body fluid like water, in caie the cor-
}>ufclcs, it was made up of, were by their Creator made fmall enough, and put into
uch an actual motion, as might make them glide along one another. And as we
now fay, the fea confifts of water (notwithftanding the faline, terreftrial, and other
bodies mingled with it) fuch a liquor may well enough be called water, becaufe that
was the grcatcft of the known bodies, whereunto it was like •, though, that a body
may be fluid enough to appear a liquor, and yet contain corpufcles of a very differing
nature, you will eafily believe, if you but expofc a good quantity of vitriol in a
ftrong veffel to a competent fire. For although it contains both aqueous, earthy,
faline, fulphureous, and metalline corpufcles, yet the whole mafs will at firft be fluid
like water, and boil like a feething-pot.
I might eafily (continues Carntades) enlarge myfelf on fuch confederations, if I
were now obliged to give you my judgment or the Th^lcfian and Helmontian hypothefis.
But, whether or ro we conclude, that all things were at firlt generated of
water, I may deduce from what I have tried concerning the growth of vegetables,
nourifhed with water, all that I now propofed to myfelf or need at prefent to prove }
namely, that fait, fpirit, earth, and even oil (though that be thought of all bodies
the molt oppofite to water) may be produced out or water ; and confequently, that a
Chymical principle, as well as a Peripatetic element, may (in fomc cafes) be generated
anew, or obtained from fuch a parcel of matter, as was not endowed with the form
of fuch a principle or element before.
And having thus, Eleutberius, evinced, that it is poffible, that fuch fubftances as
thofr, that chymifls arc wont to call their triaprimay may be generated anew; I mull
next endeavour to make it probable, that the operation of the fire does actually
(fometimcs) not or.ly divide compounded bodies into fmall parts, but compound thole
parrs after a new manner : whence confequently, for aught we know, there may
emerge as well faline and fulphureous fubftances, as bodies of other textures. And,
perhaps, it will affift us in our inquiry after the effects of the operations of the fire
upon other bodies, to confider a little, what it does to thofc mixtures, which being
prod unions of the art of man, we bell know the compofition of. You may then be
pleafed to take notice, that though foap is made up by the foap-boilers of oil or
greaic, and fait, and water diligently incorporated together ; yet if you expofc the
mafs they conftitute to a gradual fire in a retort, you fhall then indeed make a feparation,
but not of tl e fame fubftances, that were united into foap, but of others
of a diftant and yet not an elementary nature, and cfpecially of an oil very (harp and
fcetn'., and of a very differing quality from that, which was imployed to make the
foap. So, if you mingle in a due proportion fal armoniac with quick-lime, and diltil

them by degrees of fire, you fhali not divide the fal armoniac from the quick-lime,
though the one be a volatile, and the other a fixed fubftancc, but that, which will
afcend, will be a fpirit much more fugitive, fenetrant, and (linking, than fal armoniac
and there will remain with the quick-lime all, or very near all the fea-falt, that
concurred to make up the fal armoniac ; concerning which fea-falt I (hall, to fatisfy
you how well it was united to the lime, inform you, that I have, by making the fire
at length very vehement, caufed both the ingredients to melt in the retort itfelf into
one mafs, and fuch manes are apt to relent in the moift air. If it be here objected,
that thefe inftances are taken from factitious concretes, which are more compounded
than thofe, which nature produces ; I lhall reply, that befides that I have mentioned
them as much to illuftrate what I propofed, as to prove it ; it will be difficult toevince,
that nature herfclf does not make decompounded bodies ; I mean, mingle together
fuch mixt bodies, as arc already compounded of elementary, or rather ot more
iimple ones. For vitriol (for inftance) though I have fometimes taken it out of mineral
earths, where nature had without any afiiftance of art prepared it to my hand,
is really, though chymifts are pleafed to reckon it among falts, a decompounded
body, confifting (as I lhall have occalion to declare anon) of a terreftrial fubftancc,
of a metal, and alfo of at leaft one faline body, of a peculiar, and not elementary
nature. And we fee alfo in animals, that their bjpod may be compofed of divers
very differing mixt bodies, fince we find it obferved, that divers fea fowl tafte rank
of the fifti, on which they ordinarily feed •, and Hippocrates himfelf obferves, that a
child may be purged by the milk of the nurfe, it" ftic have taken claterium •, which
argues, that the purging corpufcles of the medicament concur to make up the milk
of the nurfe ; and that white liquor is generally by phyficians fuppofed to be but
blanched and altered blood. And I remember I have obferved, not far from the
slips, that at a certain time of the year the butter of that country was very offenfive
to ftrangers, by rcafon of the rank tafte of a certain herb, whereon the cows were
then wont plentifully to feed. But (proceeds Carruadts) to give you inftances of another
kind, to lhew that things may be obtained by the fire from a mixt body, that
were not pre cxiftent in it, let me remind you, that from many vegetables there may
without any addition be obtained glafs ; a body, which I prefume you will not fay was
pre-exiftcnt in it, but produced by the fire. To which I (hall add but this one example
more, namely, that by a certain artificial way of handling quickiilver, you
may without addition feparate from it at leaft a fifth, or fourth part of clear liquor j
which, with an ordinary Peripatetic, would pafs for water, and which a vulgar chymift
would not fcrup!e to call phlegm, and which, for aught I have yet fecn or heard,
is not reducible into mercury again, and confequently is more than a difguHe of it.
Now, befides that divers chymifts will not allow mercury to have any, or at leaft any
confiderable quantity of either of the ignoble ingredients, earth and water; befides
this, I fay, the great ponderoufnefs of quickfilver makes it very unlikely, that it can
have fo much water in it, as may be thus obtained from it, lincc mercury weighs
twelve or fourteen times as much as water of the fame bulk. Nay, for a further
confirmation of this argument, I will add this ftrangc relation, that two frien ds of
mine, the one a phyfician, and the o:her a mathematician, and both of tl.em peribns
of unfufpecled credit, have folemnly affured me, that after many trials, they made
to reduce mercury into water, in order to a philofophical work, upon gold (whichyet,
by the way, I now proved unlucccfsfulj they did once, by divers cohobations
reduce a pound of quickfilver into almoft a pound of water, and this, without the
addition of any other fubftancc, but only by preffing the mercury by a fkilfuily managed

naged fire, in purpofely contrived veflels. But of thefe experiments, our friend,
(fays Carneades, pointing at the Rcgifter of this dialogue) will, perhaps, give you a
more particular account, than it is ncceflary for me to do \ fince what I have now
faid, may fufficiently evince, that the fire may (bmetimes as well alter bodies as divide
them, and by it we may obtain from a mixed body, what was not pre-exiftent in it.
And how are we fure, that in no other body, what we call phlegm is barely feparated,
not produced by the action of the fire ? fince fo many other mixed bodies are of a
much lefs conftant, and more alterable nature, than mercury (by many tricks it is
wont to put upon chymills, and, by the experiments I told you of, about an hour
fince) appears to be. But, becaufe I (hall ere long have occafion to rcfume into confideration
the power of the fire to produce new concretes, I (hall no longer infift on
this argument at prefent : only I muft mind you, that if you will not dilbelieve Hel~
mont's relations, you muft confefs, that the tria prima are neither ingencrable, nor
incorruptible fubftances fince by his alkaheft fome of them may be produced of
bodies, that were before of another denomination ; and by the fame powerful menftruum
all of them may be reduced into infipid water.
Here Carneadts was about to pafs onto his third confideration, when Ekutbtrius
being defirous to hear what he could fay, to clear his fecond general confideration
from being repugnant to what he feemed to think the true theory of million, prevented
him, by telling him, I fomewhat wonder, Carneades, that you, who are in fo
many points unfatisfied with the Peripatetic opinion touching the elements and mixed
bodies, Ihould alfo feem averfc to that notion touching the manner of million, wherein
the chymifts fthough perhaps without knowing, that they do fo) agree with moft of
the antient philofophers, that preceded AriftotU \ and that for reafons fo confiderable,
that divers modern nacuralifts and phyficians, in other things unfavourable enough to
the Spagyrifts, do in this cafe fide with them againft the common opinion or the
fchools. If you fliould aik me (continues Eleutberiiu) what reafons I mean ? I mould
partly by the writings of Sennertus and other learned men, and pardy by my own
thoughts, be fupplied with more, than it were at prefent proper for me to infift
largely on. And therefore, I (hall mention only, and that briefly, three or four. Of
thefe, I ftiall take the firft, from the ftate of the controverfy itfelf, and the genuine
notion of million, which, though much intricated by the fchoolmen, I take in fhort
to be this : Arifictle% at leaft, as many of his interpreters expound him, and as indeed
he teaches in fome places, where he profcfledly diflents from the antients, declares
million to be luch a mutual penetration, and perfect, union of the mingled elements,
that there is no portion of the mixed body, how minute foevcr, which does
not contain all, and every of the four elements, or in which, if you pleafe, all the
elements are not. And I remember, that he reprehends the million taught by the
antients, as too flight or grols, for this rcafon, that bodies mixed according to their
hypothefis, though they appear to human eyes, would not appear fuch to the acute
eyes of a lynx, whole pcrfeclcr fight would difcern the elements, if they were no
otherwife mingled, than as his prcdeceflon would have it, to be but blended, not
united •, whereas the antients, though they did not all agree about what kind of bodies
were mixed, yet they did almoit unanimoufly hold, that in a compounded body,
though the Mifcibilia, whether elements, principles, or whatever they pleafed to call
diem, were aflociated in luch ('mail parts, and with (<t much exactnefs, that there was
no fenfiblepart of the mafs, but feemed to be of the fame nature with the reft, and
with the whole; yet as to the atoms, or other infcnfiblc parcels of matter, whereof
each of the Mifcibilia confilled, they retained each of them its own nature, being but

by apportion or juxta-pofition united with the reft into one body. So that although
by virtue of this compofition the mixed body did, perhaps, obtain divers new qualities
; yet ftill the ingredients, that compounded it, retaining their own nature, were
by the dcftru&ion of the compofitum leparable from each other, the minute parts
difengaged from thofe of a differing nature, and aflbciated with thofc of their own
fort, returning to be again, fire, earth, or water, as they were before they chanced tobe
ingredients of that compofitum. This may be explained (continues EUutberius)
by a piece of cloth made or white and black threads interwoven, wherein though the
whole piece appear neither white nor black, but of a refulting colour, that is grey,
yet each of the white and black threads, that compofe it, remains what it was before,,
as would appear, if the threads were pulled afundcr, and forted each colour by itfelf.
This (purfues Eleutbet iu.* J being, as 1 underftand it, the ftate of the controversy, and
the Ariftotelians, after their matter, commonly defining, that million is mifcibiliumalteratorum
unto, that feenit. to comport much better with the opinion of the Chymifts,
than with that of their adverfaries ; fince, according to that, as the newly-mentioned
example declares, there is but a juxta-pofition of fcparable corpufcles, retaining each
its own nature ; whereas, according to the Ariftotelians, when what they are pleafedto
call a mixed body, refults from the concourfc of the elements, the Mifcibilia cannot
fo properly be faid to be altered, as deftroyed, fince there is no part in the
mixed body, how fmall focver, that can be called either fire, or air, or water, or
earth.
Nor indeed, can I well underftand, how bodies can be mingled other ways, than
as I have declared, or, at lcaft, how they can be mingled, as our Peripatetics would
have it. For whereas AriftetU tells us, that, if a drop of wine be put into teiTthouknd
meafures of water, the wine being overpowered by fo vaft a quantity of water,
will be turned into it, he fpeaks, to my apprehenfion, very improbably. For, though
one fhould add to that quantity of water as many drops ofwine, as would a thoufand
times exceed it all, yet, by his rule, the whole liquor (hould not be a cram, a mixture
of wine and water, wherein the wine would be predominant, but water only j fince
the wine being added but by a drop at a time, would ftill fall into nothing but water,
and confequently would be turned into it. And, if this would hold in metals too,
it were a rare fecret for goldfmiths, and refiners ; for by melting a mafs of gold, or
filver, and by but carting into it lead or antimony, grain after grain, they might at
pleafure, within a reafonable compafs of time, turn what quantity they defire, of
the ignoble into the noble metals. And, indeed, fince a pint of wine, and a pint
of water, amount to about a quart of liquor, it feems manifeft to fenfe, that thefc
bodies do not totally penetrate one another, as one would have it i but, that each
retains its own dimenfionsj and confequently, that they are, by being mingled, only
divided into minute bodies, that do but touch one another with their furfaces, as do
the grains of wheat, rye, barley, &c. in a heap of feveral forts of corn. And unlefs
we fay, that as when one meafure of wheat, for inftance, is blended with- a hundred
meafures of barley, there happens only a juxta-pofition and fuperficial contact
betwixt the grains of wheat, and as many or thereabouts of the grains of barley fo,
when a drop of wine is mingled with a great deal of water, there is but an appofition
of fo many vinous corpufdes to a correfpondent number of aqueous ones : unlcfs I
fay, this be faid, 1 fee not how that abfurdity will be avoided, whercunto the Stoical
notion of million (namely by y^xvf^< or confufion) was liable, according to which
the leaft body may be co-extended with the greateft : fince in a mixt body, wherein,
before die elements were mingled, there was, for inftance, but one pound of water

to ten thoufand of earth, yet according to them there muft not be the leaft part of
that compound, that confided not as well of earth, as water. But I infift, perhaps,
too long (fays Eleuthtrius) upon the proofs afforded me by the nature of million
:
wherefore I will but name two or three other arguments ; whereof the firft (hall be,
that, according to Arifiotle himfclf, the motion of a mixt body follows the nature of
the predominant element, as thofe, wherein the earth prevails, tend towards the
centre of heavy bodies. And fmcc many things make it evident, that in divers mixt
bodies the elementary qualities are as well active, though not altogether lo much lb,
as in the elements themielves ; it feems not rcafonablc to deny the actual exigence of
the elements in thofe bodies, wherein they operate.
To which I Hull add this convincing argument, that experience manifefts, and
Ariftctk confeffes it, that the Mjcibilia may be again feparated from a mixt body,
as is obvious in the chymical relolutions of plants and animals, which could not be,
unlcfs they did actually retain their forms in it. For fince, according to AriftotU%
and 1 think, according to truth, there is but one common mafs of all things, which
he has been pleafcd to call materia prima ; and fince it is not therefore the matter,
but the form, that conltitutes and difcrimiriates things, to fay, that the elements remain
not in a mixt body, according to their forms, but according to their matter,
is not to fay, that they remain there at all fince although thofe portions of matter
were earth and water, &c. before they concurred, yet the refulting body being once
conftitutcd, may as well be faid to be fimple as any of the elements ; the matter
being confefiedly of the fame nature in all bodies, and the elementary forms being,
according to this hypothefis, perifhed and abolilhed.
And Jaftly, and if we will confult chymical experiments, we dull find the advantages
of the chymical doctrine above the Peripatetic little lefs than palpable. For
in that operation, that refiners call quartation, which they employ to purify gold,
although three parts of filver be fo exquilitely mingled by fufion with a fourth part
of gold (whence the operation is denominated) that the refulting mafs acquires feveral
new qualities, by virtue of the compofition, and that there is lcarce any i'enfible part
of it, that is not compofed of both the metals ; yet if you call this mixture into aqua
fortis, the filver will be dilTolved in the menflruum, and the gold like a dark or black
powder will fall to the bottom of it, and either body may be again reduced into fuch
a metal as it was before ; which fliews, that it retained its nature, notwithftanding
its being mixt per minima with the other. We likewile fee, that though one part of
pure fii\cr be mingled with eight or ten parts, or more, of lead ; yet the fire will
upon the cupel eafily and perfectly feparate them again. And that, which I would
have you peculiarly conlidcr on thisoccafion, is, that not only in chymical anatomies
there is a ftparation made of the elementary ingredients, but that lome mixt bodies
afford a very much greater quantity of this or that element or principle, than of another
•, as we lee, that turpentine and amber yield much more oil and fulphur, than
they do water ; whereas wine, which is coi fefied to be a perfectly mixt body, yields
but a little inflammable fpirit, or fulphur, and not much more earth ; but affords a
vaft proportion cf phlegm or water. Which could not be, if, as the Peripatetics
fuppole, every, even of the minuted particles, were of the fame nature with the
whole, and confequcntly did contain both earth and water, and air, and fire. Wherefore
as to what AriJIotU principally, and almod only objects, that unlefs his opinion
be admitted, there would be no true and perfect million, but only aggregates or heaps
of contiguous corpufclcs, which, though the eye of a man cannot dil'cern, yet the
eye of a lynx might perceive not to be of the fame nature with one another and with

their totum, as the nature of mi(Hon requires, if he do not beg the queftion, and
make miftion to confift in what other naturalifts deny to be rcquifite to it, yet he, at
leaft, objects that as a great inconvenience, which I cannot take lor fuch, till he have
brought as confiderablc arguments as I have propofed to prove the contrary, to evince,
that nature makes other miftions than fuch as I have allowed, wherein the MifcilnSm
are reduced into minute parts, and united as far as fenfe can difcern : which if you
will not grant to be fufficient for a true miftion, he muft have the fame quarrel with
nature herfclf, as with his adverlarics.
Wherefore (continues Eleuiberius) I cannot but fomewhat marvel, that Carneades
Ihould oppofe the doctrine of the chymifts in a particular, wherein they do as well
agree with his old miftrefs, Nature, as dhTcnt from his old adverfary, Arifiotle.
I must not (replies Carneades) engage myfelf at prtfent to examine thoroughly the
controvcrfies concerning miftion : and if there were no third thing, but that I were
reduced to embrace ablolutely and unrefervedly either the opinion of Ariftttle, or that
of the philofophers, that went before him, I (hould look upon the latter, which the
chymifts have adopted, as the more defenfible opinion. But becaufe differing in the
opinions about the elements irom both parties, I think I can take a middle couric,
and difcourfc to you of miftion, after a way, that does neither perfectly agree, nor
perfectly difagree with either : as I will not peremptorily define, whether there be not
cafes, wherein fomc phenomena of miftion feem to favour the opinion, that the
chymifts patrons borrowed of the antients, I lhall only endeavour to Ihew you, that
there are fomc cafes, which may keep the doubt, which makes up my fecond general
confideration, from being unreasonable.
I shall then freely acknowledge to you (fays Carneades) that I am not over-well
Satisfied with the doctrine, that is afcribed to driftctle, concerning miftion ; efpecially,
fincc it teaches, that the four elements may again be Separated from the mixt body
;
whereas, if they continued not in it, it would not be lb much a feparation as a production.
And I think the anticnt philofophers, that preceded Arifiotk% and chymifts,
who have fince received the fame opinion, do fpeak of this matter more intelligibly,
if not more probably, than the Peripatetics : but though they fpeak congruoully
enough to their believing, that there are a certain number of primogenial bodies, by
whofe concourfe all thole we call mixt are generated, and which, in the deftruftion of
mixt bodies, do barely part company, and reduce from one another, juft fuch as they
were when they came together; yet I, who meet with very few opinions, that I can
entirely acquu Ice in, muft confcls to you, that I am inclined to differ, not only from
the Ariftotelians, but from the old philofophers anil the chymifts, about the nature
of miltion. And if you will give me leave, I fhall briefly propofe to you my prcfent
notion of it, provided you will look upon it, not fo much as an affertion as an
hypothefis •, in talking of which, I do not now pretend to propofe and debate the
whole dectrinc of miftion, but to (hew, that it is not improbable, that fome times
mingled (ubftancea may be lo llrictly united, that it doth not by the ufual operations
of ihv fire, by which chymifts arc wont to fuppofe themiervtS to have made the
analyfis of mixt bodies, fufneicntly appear, that in fuch bodies the Mifcibilia, that
concurred to make them up, do each ot them retain its own peculiar nature •, End by
the fpagyrifts fires may be moreeafily extricated and recovered, than altered; either
by a change of text, re in the parts of the fame ingredient, or by an allocation with
fomc parts of another ingredient, more ftrict than was that of the parts of this or that

Ic»wstoir then (refumes Carneades) that, not to mention thoftr iwproper feind*
of million, wherein homogeneous bodies are joined, as when water is mingled with
water, or two veffels full of the fame kind of wine with one another, the million T
am now to difcourfc of fcems, generally fpeaking, to be but an union ftr minima of
any two or more bodies of differing denominations ; as when alh.es and land are colliquated
into glafs, or antimony and iron into regulus martis, or wine and water are
mingled, and iugar is diflblved in the mixture. Now in this general notion of mifcion>
it does not appear clearly comprehended, that the MifcibiHa or ingredients do in their
fmall parts io retain their nature, and remain diftind in the compound, that they may
thence by the fire be again taken afunder : for though I deny not, that in fome
millions of certain permanent bodies this recovery of the fame ingredients may be
made, yet I am not convinced, that it will hold in all, or even in moll, or that it is
neccllarily dcduciblc from chymical experiments, and the true notion of million.
To explain this a little, I affume, that bodies may be mingled, and that very durably,,
that are not elementary, nor have been relblved into elements or principles, that they
may be mingled ; as is evident in the regulus of colliquated antimony, and ironnewly
mentioned v and in gold coin, which lafls fo many ages \ wherein generally the
gold is alloyed by the mixture of a quantity, greater or lerTer (in our mints they ufe
about a 12th part) of either filver, or copper, or both. Next, I copfidcr, that there
being but one univerfal matter of things, as it is known that the Aritlotelians themfelves
acknowledge, who call it materia prima (about which neverthclefs I like not all
their opinions) the portions of this matter feem to differ from one another but in certain
qualities or accidents, fewer or more ; upon whofe account the corporeal fubilancc
they belong to receives its denomination, and is referred to this or that particular
fort of bodies : lb that if it come to lofe, or be deprived of thofc qualities,
though it ceai'es not to be a body, yet it ceafes from being that kind of body as. a
plant, or animal, or red, green, fweet, four, or the like. I confidcr, thac it very
often happens, that the fmall parts of bodies cohere together but by immediate contact
and reft, and that, however, there are few bodies, whole minute parts flick lb
clofc together, to what caufc foever their combination be afcribed, but that it is poffiblc
to meet with fome other body, whofe fmall parts may get between them, and fodisjoin
them 1 or may be fitted to cohere more ftrongly with fome of them, than thofc
fome do with the refl •, or at lcaft may be combined fo clofely with them, as that
neither the fire, nor the other ufual inllruments of chymical anatomies will feparate
thern. Thefe things being premifed, I will not peremptorily deny, but that there
may be fome clullers of particles, wherein the particles are fo minute, and the coherence
fo Uriel, or both, that when bodies of differing denominations, and confifting
of fuch durable ckuters, happen to be mingled., though the compound body made
up of them miy be very differing from either of die ingredients, yet each of the
little maffes or clutters may fo retain its own nature, as to be again feparable, fuch as
it was bcrbrr. As when gold and filver being melted together in a due proportion
(for in every proportion, the refiners will tell you, that the experiment will not fucceed)
aqua tonh will diffolvc the filver, and leave the gold untouched •, by which
means, as you ki'ely noted, both the metals may be recovered tVo:n the mixed mafs.
But (continues Carmades) there arc other clullers, wherein the particles Hick not lb
dole together, bu* that they may meet with corpufclcs of another denomination,
which are diipoied to be more Clofely united with fome of them, than they were
among themfelvcs. And in fuch cafe, two thus combining corpufcks lofing that
lhape, or fize, or motion, or other accident, upon whole account they weie endowed

TOth fuch a determinate quality or nature, each of them really ceafes to be a corpufcle
of the fame denomination it was before ; and from the coalition of thefe there
•may emerge a new body, as really one, as either of the corpufcles was before they
were mingled, or, if you pleafe, confounded : Gnce this concretion is really endowed
with its own diftincT: qualities, and can no more by the fire, or any other known way
of analyfis, be divided again into the corpufcles, that at firft concurred to make it,
than either of them could, by the fame means, be fubdivided into other particles.
But (fays Eletttberius) to make this more intelligible by particular examples; if you
duTolve copper in aqua fortis, or fpirit of nitre (for I remember not which 1 ufed,
nor do I think it much material) you may by cryftallizing the folution obtain a goodly
vitriol ; which, though by virtue of the compofition it have manifeftly divers qualities,
not to be met with in either of the ingredients, yet it feems, that the nitrous
fpirits, or at leaft many of them, may in this compounded mafs retain their former
.nature : for having for trial-fake diftilled this vitriol fpirit, there came over (lore of
red fumes, which by that colour, by their peculiar ftink, and by their lournefs, manifefted
themfelves to be nitrous fpirits, and that the remaining calx continued
copper, I fuppofc you will eafily believe. But if you diffolve minium, which is but
lead powdered by the fire, in good fpirit of vinegar, and cryftallizc the folution, you
fhall not only have a faccharine fait exceedingly differing from both its ingredients i
but the union of fome parts of the menftruum with fomc of thofc of the metal is fo
drift, that the fpirit of vinegar feems to be, as fuch, deftroyed ; fince the falinc
corpufcles have quite loft that acidity, upon whofe account the liquor was called
fpirit of vinegar ; nor can any fuch acid parts, as were put to the minium, be fcparated
by any known way from the faccbarum Saturni refulting from them both. For
not only there is no fournefs at all, but an admirable fweetnefs to be taftcd in the concretion
; and not only I found not that fpirit of wine, which otherwife will immediately
hifs, when mingled with ftrong fpirit of vinegar, would hifs being poured
XL^onfaccbarum Saturni, wherein yet the acid fait of vinegar, did it furvive, may feem
to be concentrated , but upon the diftillation of faccbarum Saturni by itfelf, I found
indeed a liquor very penetrant, but not at all acid, and differing as well in fmell and
other qualities, as in tafte, from the fpirit of vinegar which likewife feemed to
have left fomc of its parts very firmly united to the caput mortuum, which though of
a leaden nature was in fmell, colour, &c. differing from minium. Which brings
into my mind, diat though two powders, the one blue, and the other yellow, may
appear a green mixture, without either of them lofing its own colour, as a good microfcope
has fometimes informed me ; yet having mingled minium and fal armoniac
in a requifite proportion, and expofed them in a glafs veflel to the fire, the whole
mafs became white, and the red corpufcles were deftroyed : for though the calcined
lead was feparable from the fait, yet you will cafily believe it did not part from it in
the form of a red powder, fuch as was the minium, when it was put to the fal armoniac.
I leave it alfo to be confidered, whether in blood, and divers other bodies,
it be probable, that each of the corpufcles, that concur to make a compound body,
doth, though fome of them in fome cafes may, retain its own nature in it, fo that
chymifts may extricate each fort of them from all the others, wherewidi it concurred
to make a body of one denomination.
I know there may be a diltinction betwixt matter immanent, when the material
parts remain, and retain their own nature in the things matcriatcd, as fome of the
fchoolmen fpeak (in which fenfe, wood, ftones and lime arc the matter of a houfe \)
and tranficnt, wluch in the matcriatcd thing is fo altered, as to receive a new form,

without being capable of re-admitting again the old. In which fcnfe the friends of
this diftinftion fay, that chyle is the matter of blood, and blood that of a human
body, of all whole parts it is prcfumed to be the aliment. I know alio, that it maybe
laid, that of material principles, Ibme are common to all mixt bodies, as Arijlotle's
four elements, or the chymifts tria prima ; others peculiar, which belong to this or
that fort of bodies as butter and a kind of whey may be laid to be the proper principles
of cream : and I deny not, but that thefc diftinftions may in fome cafes be of
ule; but partly by what I have (aid already, and partly by what I am to fay, you
may eafily enough guefs, in what fenfe I admit them, and difcern, that in fuch a lenle
they will either illullrate fome of my opinions, or at leaft will not overthrow any of
them.
To prolecute then what I was faying before, I will add to this purpofe, that fince
the major part of chymifts credit what thofe they call philolbphers affirm of their
Hone, I may reprefent to them, that though when common gold and lead arc mingled
together, the lead may be fevered almoll unaltered from ihc gold ; yet if inflead
of gold a tantillum of the red elixir be mingled with a latum, their union will be
lb indilfoluble in the perfeft gold, that will be produced by it, that there is no
known, nor perhaps no pofliblc way of feparating the diftufed elixir from the fixed
lead, but they both conltitute a moft permanent body, wherein the faturn feems to
have quite loft its properties, that made it be called lead, and to have been rather
tranfmuted by the elixir, than barely afibciatrd to it. So that it leems not always
nccefiary, that the bodies, that are put together per minima, mould each retain its
own nature ; fo as when the mafs itfelf is difllpatcd by the fire, to be more difpofed
to re-appear in its prii>ine form, than in any new one, which by a firictcr afibciation
of its parts with thofe of fome of the other ingredients of the compofitum, than with
one another, it may have acquired.
Aso if it be ohjc&ed, that unlefs the hypothefis I oppofe be admitted, in fuch cafes
as 1 have propofed, there would not be an union, but a dellruc'tion of mingled bodies,
which feems all one as to fay, that of fuch bodies there is no miftion at all j I
anfwer, that though the fubftances, that .ire mingled, remain, only thtir accidents
are deltroycd, and though we may with tolerable' congruity call them Mifdlilia, bccaufe
they are diftindl bodies before they are put together, however afterwards they
are fo confounded, that I Ihould rather call them concrc;ions, or refulring bodies,,
than mixed ones and though, perhaps, fome other and better account may be propofed,
upon which the name of million may remain ; yet, if what I have faid be
thought reafon, I lhall not wrangle about words, though I think it fitter to alter a
term of art, than reject a new truth, becaufe it fuits not with it. If it be alto objected,
that this notion of mine, concerning miftion, though it may be allowed,
when bodies already compounded are put to be mingled, yet it is not applicable to
thole miitions, that arc immediately made of the elements, or principles the.Selves j
I anfwer in die firft place, that I here confider the nature of million fomewhat more
generally, than the chymifts ; who yet cannot deny, that there are oftentimes mixtures,
and thofe very durable ones, made of bodies, that arc not clen enrary. And
in the next place, that though it may be probably pretended, that in thofr mixtures
that are made immediately of the bodies, that are called principles or elements, the
mingled ingredients may better retain their own nature in the compounded mafs, and
be more ealily feparated from thence ; yet, befides that it may be doubted, whether
there be any fuch primary bodies, I fee not why the reafon I alleged, of the deftructib.
lity of the inga-dicnts of bodies in general, may not fometimes be applicable to

fair, fulphur, or mercury ; till it be (hewn upon what account we are to believe them
privileged. And however (if you pleafc but to recall to mind, to what purpofc I told
?ouatfiril t
I meant to fpeak ox mixtion at this time) you will perhaps allow, that what
have hitherto difcourfed about it, may not only give fome light to the nature of ic
in general (efpecially when I mall have an opportunity to declare to you my thoughts
on that fubjeft more fully) but may on fome occafions alfo be ferviceable to me in.the
enfuing part of this difcourfe.
Bu r to look back now to that part of our difcourfe, whence this excurfion concerning
million has fo long diverted us, though we there deduced, from the differing
fubftances obtained from a plant nourifhed only with water, and from fome other
things, that it was not necclTary, that nature mould always compound a body at firft
of all fuch differing bodies, as the fire could afterwards make it afford ; yet this is not
all, that may be collected from thofe experiments. For from them there feems alio
deducible fomcthing, that fubverts another foundation of the chymical doctrine.
For fince that (as we have feen) out of fair water alone, not only fpirit, but oil, and1
fair, and earth may be produced , it will follow, that fait and fulphur arc not prima*
genial bodies, and principles, fince they are every day made out of plain water by thetexture,
which the feed or feminal principle of plants put it into. And this would
not perhaps feem fo ftrange, if, though pride or negligence, we were not wont tooverlook
the obvious and familiar workings of nature i tot if we confiderwhat flight
qualities they are, that ferve to denominate one of the tria prima, we (hall find, that
nature does frequently enough work as great alterations in divers parcels of matter ;
for to be readily diflbluble in water, is enough to make the body, that is fo, pafs for
a fait. And yet I fee not, why from a new fhurHing and difpofition of the component
particles of a body, it mould be much harder for nature to compofe a body diffoluble
in water, of a portion of water, that was not fo before, than of the liquid*
fubftance of an egg, which will eafily mix with water, to produce by the bare warmth:
of a hatching hen, membranes, feathers, tendons, and other parts, that are not diffoluble
in water as that liquid fuoftance was: nor is the hardnefs and brittlenefs of fait
more difficult for nature to introduce into fuch a yielding body as water, than it is
for her to make the bones of a chick out of the tender fuliftance of the liquors of an
egg. But inftead of profecuting this confederation, as I eafily might, I will proceed
as loon as I have taken notice of an objection, that lies in my way. For I eafily forefee
it will be alleged, that the above mentioned examples are all taken from plants,
and animals, in whom the matter is fafhioned by the platlic power of the feed, or
fometfung analogous thereunto. Whereas the fire does not adt like any of the feminal
principles, but deftroys them all-, when they come within its reach* But to this
I fhall need at prefent to make but this eafy anfwer, that whetht-r it be a feminal
principle, or any other, which fafhions that matter after thofe various manners 1 have
mentioned to you, yet it is evident, that either by the plaftic principle alone, or that
and heat together, or by fome other caufc capable to contex the matter, it is yet pof*-
fible, that the nuctcr may be anew contrived into fuch bodies^ And it is only for the
poOibUity of this, that I am now contending.

PART III.
WHAT I have hitherto difcourfed, EUutbtrius, (fays his friend to him) has,
I prefume, ftiewn you, that a confidering man may very well oueftion the
truth of thole very fuppofitions, which Chymifts as well as Peripateticks, without
proving, take for granted i and upon which depends the validity of the inferences
they draw from their experiments. Wherefore having difpatched that, which though
a chymift perhaps will not, yet I do, look upon as the nu.ll important, as well as
difficult, part of my talk, it will now be feafonable for me to proceed to the confideration
of the experiments themfelves, wherein they are wont fo much to triumph and
glory. And thefe will the rather defcrve a ferious examination, becauie thofe, that
alledge them, are wont to do it with fo much confidence and oftentation, that they
have hitherto impofed upon almoft all pcrfons, without excepting philolophers and
phyficians themfelves, who have read their books, or heard them talk. For fome
learned men have been content rather to believe what they fo boldly affirm, than be
at the trouble and charge, to try whether or no it be true. Others again, who have
curiofity enough to examine the truth of what is averred, want Ikill and opportunity
to do what they defire. And the generality even of learned men, feeing the chymifts
(not contenting themfelves with the fchools to amufc the world with empty words)
actually perform divers ftrange things, and, among thofe, refolve compound bodies
into fcveral fubftances, not known by former philolophers to be contained in them •,
men I fay, feeing thefe things, and hearing with what confidence chymifts aver the
fubftances obtained from compound bodies by the fire to be the true elements, or, (as
they fpeak) hypoftatical principles of them, arc forward to think it but juft, as well
as modeft, that according to the logicians rule, the fkilful artifts fhould be credited
in their own art ; efpecially when thofe things, whole nature they fo confidently take
upon them to teach others, are not only productions of their own flciU, but fuch as
others know not elfe what to make of.
But though (continues Carnta&es) the chymifts have been able, upon fome or other
of the mentioned accounts, not only to delight but amaze, and almoft to bewitch
even learned men \ yet fuch as you and I, who are not unpraclilcd in tlvc trade, muft
not fuffer ourielves to be impofed upon by hard names, or bold afiertions ; nor to be
dazled by that light which fhould but affift us to difcern tilings the more clearly.
It is one thing to be able to help nature to produce things, and another thing to underftand
well the nature of the things produced. As we fee, that many pcrfons that
can beget children, arc for all that as ignorant of the number and nature of the parts,
efpecially the internal ones, that conftitute a child's body, as they that never were
parents. Nor do I doubt, but you will excufc me, if, as I thank the chymifts for
the things their analyfis Ihews me, fo I take the liberty to confider, how many, and

what they are, without being aftonifhed at them •, as if, whomever hath (kill enough
to fhew men feme new thing of his own making, had the right to make them believe
whatfoevcr he pleafcs to tell them concerning it.
Wmer efore, I will now proceed to my third general confideration ; which is, that
it does not appear, that three is precifely and univerfally the number of the diftinft
fubftances or elements, whercunto mixt bodies are relbluble by the fire : I mean, that
it is not proved by chymifts, that all the compound bodies, which are granted to be
perfectly mixt, are upon their chymical analyfis divifible each of them into juft three
diitinct fubftances, neither more nor lefs, which are wont to be looked upon as elementary,
or may as well be reputed lb as thofe, that are fo reputed. Which laft
claufe I fubjoin, to prevent your objecting, that foine of the fubftances I may have
occafion to mention by and by, are not perfectly homogeneous, nor confequcntly
worthy of the name of principles. For that which I am now to confider is, into how
many differing fubftances, that may plaufibly pal's for the elementary ingredients of
a mixt body, u may be analyzed by the fire •, but whether each of thefe be uncompounded
I referve to examine, when I fhall come to the next general confideration j
where 1 hope to evince,, that the fubftances, which the chymifts not only allow, but
affert to be the component principles of the body refolved into them, are not wont to
be uncompounded.
Now there are two kind of arguments (purfues Carneades} which may be brought
to make my third propofition fecm probable •, one fort of them being of a more fpeculativc
nature, and the other drawn from experience. To begin then with the firft
of thefe.
But as Carneades was going to do as he had faid, Eleutberius interrupted him, by
faying with a fomewhat foiling countenance •,
If you have no mind I fhould think, that the proverb, that good wits have bad.
memories, is rational and applicable to you, you muft not forget now you are upon
the fpcculative confiderations, that may relate to the number of the elements, that
youifelf did not long fincc deliver and concede fomc propofitions in favour of the
chymical doctrine, which 1 may without difparagement to you think it uneafy, evenfor
Carneades to anfwer.
I have not, replies he, forgot the conceffions you mean; but I hope too, that you
have not forgot neither with wh.it cautions they were made, when I had not yet
afTumed the pcrlbn I am now fuftaining. But however, I (hall, to content you, lb
difcourfc of my third general confideration, as to let you fee, that I am not unmindful
of the things you would have me remember.
To talk then again according to fuch principles as I then made ufe of, I fha'.l
reprcfenr, that if it be granted rational to fuppoie, as I then did, that the elements
confuted at Iir!t of certain fmall and primary coalitions of the minute particles of
matter into corpufclcs very numerous, and very like each other, it will not be abl'urd
to conceive, that fuch primary clufters may be of far more forts than three or rive i
and confequcntly, thatne need not fuppoie, that in each cf the compound bodies we
are treating cf, there mould be found juft three forts of fuch primitive coalitions,,
as we are fpcaking of.
And if, according to this notion, we allow a confidence number of differing
elements, I may add, th»t i: items very poflible, that to the coiiltitution of one fort
of mixt bodies two kin Js of elementary ones may fulficc (as I lately exemplified to
you, in ihat moll durable concrete, gtafs,) another fort of mixts may be compolciof
three elements, another of tour, ar.oihcr of five* a id another pcrhao; of miny.

more. So that, according to this notion, there can be no determinate number
affigned, as that of the elements of all iorts of compound bodies whatfoever } it being
very probable, that fome concretes confift of fewer, fome of more elements.
Nay, it Uocs not fcem impoflible, according to thele principles, but that there may
be two forts of mixts, whereof the one may not have any ot all the fame elements as
the other confifb ofi as we oftentimes fee two words, whereof one has not any one
of the letters to be met with in the other i or as we often meet with divers electuaries,
in which no ingredient (except fugar) is common to any two of them. I will
not here debate, whether there may not be a multitude of thefc corpufcles, which by
rcafon of dieir being primary and fimp.e, might be called elementary, if feveral forts
of them fhould convene to compofe any body, which are as yet free, and neither as
yet contcxed and entangled with primary corpufcles of other kinds, but remain
liable to be fubdued and fafhioned by leminal principles, or the like powerful and
tranfmuting agent \ by whom they may be io connected among themfelves, or
with the parts of the bodies, as to make the coirpound bodies, whole ingredients
they are, rcfoluble into more, or other elements than thole that chymifts have hitherto
taken notice of.
To all which I may add, that fince it appears, by what I obferved to you of the
permanency of gold and filver, that even corpufcles, that are not of an elementary,
but compounded nature, may be of fo durable a texture, as to remain indiftblublc in
the ordinary analyfis that Chymifts make of bodies by the fire •, it is not impoflible,
but that, though there were but three elements, yet there may be a greater number
of bodies, which the wonted ways of anatomy will not difcover to be no elementary
bodies.
But, (fays Carneades) having thus far, in compliance to you, talked conjec"turally
of the number of the elements, it is now time to confider, not of how many elements
it is poffible that nature may compound mixed bodies, but (at leaft, as far as the
ordinary experiments of chymifts will inform us) of how many fhe doth make
them up.
I sav then, that it does not by thefe fufficiently appear to me, that there is any
one determinate number of elements to be uniformly met with in all the feveral forts
of bodies allowed to be perfectly mixed.
And for the more diftinft proof of this propofition, I fhall in the firft place reprefent,
that there are divers bodies, which I could never fee by fire divided into 16 many
as three elementary fubftanccs. I would fain (as 1 laid lately to Pbikpcnus) fee that
fixed and noble metal we call gold, le parated into fait, fulphur and mercury
and if any man will fubmit to a competent forfeiture in cafe or failing, I fhall willingly,
in cafe of profjerous fucrefs, pay for both the matt rials and the charges of
fuch an experiment. It is rot, that after what I have iri d myfclf I dare peremptorily
deny, tha: there may out of gold be extracted a certain fubftancc, which I cannot
hindei i hymifts from calling its tincture or fulphur-, and which leaves the remaining
body deprived cf its wonted colour. Nor am I fure, that there cannot be drawn
out of the lame metal a real quick and running mercury. But for the fait of gold,
I nevir could either fee it, or be fu.isficd that there was ever fuch a thing fcparated,
in rerum natura, by the relation of any credible cyc-witnefs. And tor the
feveral procefles, that promife that effect, the materials, that muft be wrought upon,
arc fomcwh.it too precious and coflly to be wafted upon lb groundlcfs adventures, of
which not only the fuccefs is doubtful, but the very pofiibility is not yet demonftratcd.

but their unfatisfaetorinefs, though they ihould fucceed. For the extraction of this
golden fait being in chymifts procefles prefcribed to be effected by corrofivc menftruums,
or the intervention of other faline bodies, it will remain doubtful to a wary
perfon, whether the emergent fait be that of the gold itfelf, or of the faline bodies or
fpirits employed to prepare it •, for that fuch difguifes of metals do often impole upon
artifts, I am Aire Eleutberius is not fo much a ftranger to chymiftry as to ignore. I
would likewife willingly fee the three principles feparatcd from the pure fort of virginiand,
from ofteocolla, from refined filver, from quickfilver freed from its adventitious
fulphur, from Venetian talc, which by long detention in an extreme rcverberium, I
could but divide into fmallcr particles, not the conftituent principles ; nay, which,
when I caufed it to be kept 1 know not how long, in a glals-houfe fire, came out in
the figure its lumps had, when put in, though altered to an almoft amcthyftine colour
; and from divers other bodies, which it were now unneceffary to enumerate.
For though I dare not abiblutely affirm it to be impofliblc to analyze thefe bodies
into their tria prima ; yet becaufe neither of my own experiments, nor any competent
teftimony hath hitherto either taught me, how fuch an analyfis may be made, or fatisfied
me, that it hath been fo ; 1 mult take the liberty to refrain from believing it,
.
till the chymifts prove it, or give us intelligible and practicable procefles to perform
what they pretend. For whuft they affect that enigmatical obfeurity, m ith which
they are wont to puzzle the readers of their divulged procefles concerning the analytical
preparation of gold or mercury, they leave wary perlbns much unfatisficd, whether
or no the differing fubftances, they promife to produce, be truly the hypoftatical
principles, or only fomc intermixtures of the divided bodies with thofc employed to
work upon them, as is evident in the fecming cryftals of filver, and thofe or mercury
; which, though by fome inconfiderately fuppofed to be the falts of thofe metals,
are plainly but mixtures of the metalline bodies with the faline parts of aqua fortis, or
other corrofivc liquors •, as is evident by their being reducible into filver or quickfilver,
as they were before.
I cannot but confefs (faith Eleutberius) that though chymifts may, upon probable
grounds, affirm themfelves able to obtain their tria prima from animals and vegetables,
yet I have often wondered, that they ftiould fo confidently pretend alfo, to
refolve all metalline and other mineral bodies into fait, fulphur, and mercury. For
it is a faying almoft proverbial among thofc chymifts themfelves, that are accounted
philofophers, and our famous countryman Roger Bacon has particularly adopted it i
that fadlius eft aurum facere, quam dejlruere. And I fear, with you, that gold is
not the only mineral, from which chymifts are wont fruitlefly to attempt the fcparating
of their three principles. I know indeed (continues Eleutberius) that the
learned Sennertus, even in that book, where he takes not upon him to play the advocate
for the chymifts, but the umpire betwixt them and the Peripateticks, expreflc

«divt»e, tbcriuSi I was not only glad, but fomewhat furprized to find you inclined to w' admit, that there may be a fulphur and a running mercury drawn from gold ; for
unlefs you do (as your expreffion fecmed to intimate) take the word fulphur in a very
loofe lenfe, I mull doubt, whether our chymifts can feparate a fulphur from gold
:
for when I faw you make the experiment, that I fuppofc invited you to fpeak as you
did, I did not judge the golden tincture to be the true principle of fulphur extracted
from the body, but an aggregate of fome fuch highly coloured parts of the gold, as
a chymift would have called a fulphur i:\combuftible, which in plain Englilh teems to
be little better than to call it a fulphur and no fulphur. And as for metalline mercuries,
I had not wondered at it, though you had exprefled much more feverity in
fpcaking of them ; for I remember, that having once met an old and famous artift,
twho had long been (and ftill is) chymift to a great monarch, the repute he had of a
very honcft man invited me to defire him to tell me ingenioufly, whether or no,
among his hiany labours, he had ever really extracted a true and running mercury
out or metals •, to which queflion lie freely replied, that he had never feparated a true
mercury from any metal ; nor had ever teen it really done by any man elfe. And
though gold is, of all metals, that, whofe mercury chymifts have moft endeavoured
to extract, and which they do the moft brag they have extracted ; yet the experienced
Angelas Sala, in his fpagyrical account of the feven terreftrial planets (that is, thefeven
metals) affords us this memorable teftimony, to our prefent purpofe : <%ua>iquttm (fay*
he) t5Y. experientia tamen (quam ftultorum magiftram vocamus) certe comprobavit, mtrcurium

much labour fpent upon that defign, but could never fee any fuch mercury produced
thereby. And I eafily believe what he annexes •, that be bad often fcen dttttted many
tricks and impoflurcs of cheating alcbymijis. For, the moft part of thole, that are fond
of fuch charletans, being unfkilful or credulous, or both, it is very eafy lor fuch as
have fome fkill, much craft, more boldnefs, and no confeience, to impofe upon them :
and therefore, though many profefied alchymifts, and divers perfons of quality have
told me, that they have nrade or feen the mercury of gold, or of this or that other
metal-, yet I have been ftill apt to fear, that either thefe perfons have had a defign
to deceive others, or have had not fkill and circumfpection enough to keep themfelves
from being deceived.
You recall to my mind (fays Carneades) a certain experiment I once devifed, innocently
to deceive fome perfons, and let them and o hers fee, how little is to be built
upon the affirmation of thole, that are either unfkilful or unwary, when they tell us
they have feen alchymifts make the mercury of this or that metal : and to make this
the more evident, 1 made my experiment much more flight, fhort and fimple,
than the chymifts ufual proccifes to extract metalline mercuries ; which operations
being commonly more elaborate and intricate, and requiring a much more longer time,
give the alchymifts a greater opportunity to cozen, and confequcntly arc more obnoxious
to the fpectators fulpicion. And that, wherein 1 endeavoured to make my
experiment look the more like a true analyfis, was, that 1 not only pretended, as well

rate a large proportion of manifeft and inflammable fulphur. I take then of the
filings of copper about a dram or two •, of common fublimate, powdered, the like
weight i and fal armoniac near about as much as of fublimate : thefc three being wety
mingled together, 1 put into a fmall phial with a long neck, or, which I find better,
into a glafs-urinal, which (having firft flopped it with cotton) to avoid the noxious
fumes, I approach by degrees to a competent fire of well kindl ed coals, or (which
looks better, but more endangers the glafs) to the flame of a candle; and after a
while the bottom of the glals being held juft upon the kindled coals, or in the flame,
you may in about a quarter of an hour, or, perchance, in half that time, perceive in
the bottom of the glafs fome running mercury -, and if then you take away the glals,
and break it, you (hall find a parcel of quickfilver, perhaps altogether, and perhaps
part of it in the pores of the folid mafs. You (hall find too, that the remaining lump
being held to the flame of the candle, will readily burn with a greenilh flame, and
after a little while (perchance prefently) will in the air acquire a grccnilh blue, which
being the colour that is afcribed to copper, when its bodv is unlocked, it is eafy to
£:rfuade men, that this is the true fulphur of Venus, elpecially fince not only the
Its naay be fuppoled partly to be flown away, and partly to be fublimed to the upper
part of the glafs, (whofe infide will commonly appear whitened by them) but the
metal leems to be quite deftroyed, the copper no longer appearing in a metalline
form, but almoft in that of a refinous lump : whereas, indeed, the cafe is only this,
that the faline parts of the fublimate, together with the fal armoniac, being excited
and actuated by the vehement heat, fall upon the copper, (which is a metal they can
more eafily corrode than filver) whereby the fmall parts of the mercury being freed
from the falts, that kept them afunder, and being by the heat tumbled up and down
after many occurfions, they convene into a confpicuous mafs of liquor •, and as for the
falts, fome of the more volatile of them fubliming to the upper part of the glals, the
others corrode the copper, and uniting themfelvcs with it, do ftrangely alter and difguife
its metallick form, and compole with it a new kind of concrete, inflammable
like fulphur; concerning which, I fhall not now fay anything, fince I can refer you
to the diligent obfervations, which I remember Mr. Boyle has made concerning this
odd kind of verdigreafe. But, continues Carneades finding, you know I was not cut
out for a mountebank, and therefore I will halten to relume the perfon of a fceptick,
and take up my difcourfc, where you diverted me from profecuting it.
In the next place then I conlidcr, that, as there arc iome bodies, which yield not
fo many as the three principles ;. fo there are many others, that in their relblution
exhibit more principles than three; and that therefore the ternary number is not that
of the univcrial and adequate principles of bodies. If you allow of the difcourfc I
lately made you, touching the primary aflbciations of the fmall particles of matter,
you will lcarce think it improbable, that of i'uch elementary corpufcles there may be
more lorts than eichcr three, or four, or rive. And if you will grant, what will lcarce
be denied, that corpufcles of a compounded nature may, in all the wonted examples
of chymifls, pafs for elementary, 1 fee not why you lhould think it impoffiblc, that
aqua fortis, or aqua regis, will make a feparation of colliquated filver and gold,
though the fire cannot : 16 there may be fome agent found out fo fubtile and fo
powerful, at lealt in refpect or thofe particular compounded corpufcles, as to be able
to reiolve them into ihofe more fimple ones, whereof they confift, and confequently
increufe the number of the diitincl fubltances, whereunto the mixed body has been

diftinct fubftanccs, both as to number and nature, than the fire does *, it will not a little
countenance my conjecture. But confining ourfclves to l'uch ways of analyzing mixed
bodies, as are already not unknown to chymifts, it may without abfurdity be queltioned,
whether befides thofe grofler elements of bodies, which they call fait, fulphur
and mercury, there may not be ingredients of a more fubtile nature, which being
extremely little, and not being in themfclves vifible, may efcape unheeded at the
junctures of the diftillatory veflels, though never fo carefully luted. For let me
obfervd to you one thing, which, though not taken notice of bychymifts, may be a
notion of good ufe in divers cafes to a naturalift, that we may well fufpect, that there
may be feveral forts of bodies, which are not immediate objects of any one of our
fenfcs } fincc we fee, that not only thofe little corpufcles, that iflue out of the loadftone,
and perform the wonders, for which it is juftly admired ; but the effluviums of
amber, jet, and other electrical concretes, though by their effects upon the particular
bodies difpofed to receive their action, they fecm to fall under the cognizance of our
fight, yet do they not as electrical immediately affect any of our fenfes, as do the
bodies, whether minute or greater, that we fee, feel, tafte, fcfc. But (continues
Carneadts) becaufe you may expect I fhould, as the chymifts do, confider only the
fenfible ingredients of mixt bodies, let us now fee what experience will, even as to
thefe, fuggeft to us.
It feems then questionable enough, whether from grapes varioufly ordered there
may not be drawn more diftinct fubftanccs by the help of the fire, than from molt
other mixt bodies. For the grapes themfelves being dried into raifins and diftilled,
will (befides alkali, phlegm, and earth) yield a confiderable quantity of an empyreumatical
oil, and a fpirit of a very different nature from that of wine. Alfo the
unfermented juice of grapes affords other diftilled liquors than wine doth. Thejuice
of grapes, after fermentation, will yield a fpiritus ereUns; which, if competently
rectified, will all burn away without leaving any tiling remaining. The fame fermented
juice degenerating into vinegar yields an acid and corroding fpirit. The fame
juice tunned up arms itfelf with tartar > out of which may be feparated, as out of
other bodies, phlegm, fpirit, oil, fait and earth : not to mention what fubftanccs
may be drawn from the vine itfelf, probably differing from thofe, which arc feparated
from tartaF, which is a body by itfelf, that has few refemblers in the world. And I will
further confider, that what force foever you will allow this inftance, to evince, that
there are fome bodies, that yield more elements than others, it can fcarce be
denied, but that the major part of bodies, that are divifible into elements, yield
more than three. For, befides thofe, which the chymifts are pleafed to name
hypoftatical, moft bodies contain two others, phlegm and earth; which concurring
as well as the reft to the conftitution of mixts, and being as generally, if not more,,
found in their analyfis, I fee no fufBcient caufe, why they fhould be excluded from
the number of elements. Nor will it fuffice to object, as the Paracelfians are wont
to do, that the tria prima are the moft ufeful elements, and the earth and watec
but worthjefs and unactivc i for elements being called fo, in relation to the conftituttng
of mist bodies, it fhould be upon the account of its ingrediency, not of its
ufc, that any thing fhould be affirmed or denied to be an element : and as for the
pretended ulcfutncis of earth and water, it would be confidcrcd, that ufcfulnefs, oc
the want of it, denotes only a refpect or relation to us; and therefore the prcfencc,.
or abience of it, alters not the intrinfick nature of the thing. The hurtful teeth of
vipers are, f.jr aught I know, ul'elefs to us, and yet arc not to be denied to be pans
of their bodies ; and it were hard to fhew of what greater ufc to us, than phlegm,

and eanh, are thofe undifcerned ftars, which our new telefcopes difcover to us, in
many blanched places of the Iky : and yet we cannot but acknowledge them conftituent,
and confiderably great parts of the univerfe. Bcfides that, whether or no the
phlegm and earth be immediately ufeful, but neceflary to conititute the body whence,
they are feparated ; and confequently, if the mixt body be not ufelcfs to us, thofe
conftituent parts, without which it could not have been that mixed body, may be
faid not to be unufeful to us : and though the earth and water be not fo confpicuoufly
operative (after feparation) as the other three more a&hre principles, yet in this cafe
it will not be amifs to remember the lucky fable of Mtnenius Agrippa, of die dangerous
fedition of die hands and legs, and other more bufy parts of the body, againlt
the feemingly unaclive ftomach. And to this cafe alfo wc may not unfitly apply that
reafoning of an Apoftle, to another purpofe ; If the tar jhall fay, becaufe I am not

ftitutc, and lb, though in fomewhat a remoter way, are ferviceable to us -, to exclude
them out of the number of elements, is not to imitate nature.
And on this occafion 1 cannot but take notice, that whereas the great argument,
which the chymilb are wont to employ to vilify earth and water, and make them be
looked upon as ulclefs and unworthy to be reckoned among the principles of mixed
bodies, is, that they are not endowed with fpecifick properties, but only with elementary
qualities ; of which they ufe to fpeak very flightingly, as of qualities contemptible
and unaclive ; I fee no fufficicnt peafon for this practice of the chymifls
:
for it is confefled, thai heat is an elementary quality, and yet that an almoft innumerable
company of confiderable things are performed by heat, is manifeft to them,
that duly confider the various phenomena, wherein it intervenes as a principal aclor
;
and none ought lefs to ignore or diftruft this truth than a chymift i fince almoft all
the operations and productions of his art are performed chiefly by the means of heat.
And as for cold itfclf, upon whofe account they fo defpife the earth and water, it"
they pleafe to read in the voyages of our Engldh and Dutch navigators in Nova Zembla
and other northern regions, what ftupendous things may be cHeeled by cold, they
would not perhaps think it fo dcfpicable. And not to repeat what I lately recited to
you out of Paracelfus himfclf, who by the help of an intenfe cold teaches to feparate
the quintcflence of wine; I will only now obferve to you, that the confervation of
the texture of many bodies, both animate and inanimate, does fo much depend upon
the convenient motion both of their own fluid and loofer parts, and of the ambient
bodies, whether air, water, csV. that not only in human bodies we fee, that the immoderate
or unfeafonabk coldnefs of the air (efpecially when it finds filch bodies
over-heated) does very frequendy difcompole the ceconomy of them, and occafion
variety of difealcs-, but in the folid and durable body of iron itfclf, in which one
would not expeel, that fudden cold fliould produce any notable change, it may have
fo great an operation, that if you take a wire, or other /lender piece of ftccl, and
having brought it in the fire to a white heat, you fufler it afterwards to cool leifurcly
in the air, it will, when it is cold, be much of the fame hardnefs it was of before.
Whereas, if as foon as you remove it from the fire, you plunge it into cold warer, it
will upon the fudden refrigeration acquire a very much greater hardnefs than it had
before $ nay, and will become manifeftly brittle. And dut you in:iy not impute this

to any peculiar quality in the water, or other liquor, or unctuous matter, wherein
fuch heated fteel is wont to be quenched, that it may be tempered \ I know a very
ikiltul tradefman, that divers times hardens fteel by fuddenly cooling it in a body,
that is neither a liquo^ nor lb much as moift. A trial or" that nature I remember
I have feen made. And, however, by the operation, that water has upon fteel
Suenched in it, whether upon the account ol its coldnefs and moifture, or upon
iat of any other of its qualities, it appears, that water is not always fo inefficacious
and contemptible a body, as our chymifts would have it pafs for. And, what I have
fatd of the efficacy of cold and heat, might perhaps be cafily enough carried further
by other confiderations and experiments ; were it not, that ha\ ing been mentioned
only upon the by, 1 mull not infift on it, but proceed to another fubject.
But (purfues Carneades) though I think, it evident, that earth and phlegm are to be
reckoned among the elements of moft animal and vegetable bodies, yet it is not upon
that account alone, that I think divers bodies refoluble into more fubftanccs than three.
For there are two experiments, that I have fometimes made, to (hew, that at leaft fome
mixts are divifible into more diftinct fubftanccs than five. The one of thefc experiments,
though it will be more feafonable for me to mention it fully anon, yet in
the mean time, I fhall tell you thus much of it that out of two diftilled liquors,
which pafs for elements of the bodies, whence they are drawn, I can, without addition,
make a true yellow and inflammable fulphur, notwithftanding that , the two
liquors remain afterwards diftinct. Of the other experiment, which, perhaps, will
not be altogether unworthy your notice, I mult now give you this particular account
I had long obferved, that by the diftillation of divers woods, both in ordinary, and
fome unuhial forts of veflels, the copious fpirit, that came over, had, befides a ftrong
taftc to be met with in the empyreumatical fpirits of many other bodies, an acidity
almoft like that of vinegar : wherefore I fufpected, that though the fourifh liquor
diftilled, for inftance, from box-wood, be looked upon by chymifts as barely the
fpirit of it, and therefore as one fingle element or principle ; yet it does really confift
of two differing fubftanccs, and may be divifible into them-, and confequcntly, that
fuch woods and other mixts, as abound with fuch a vinegar, may be faid to confift of
one clement or principle, more than the chymifts as yet are aware of. Wherefore
bethinking myfelf, how the feparation of thefc two fpirits might be made, I quickly
found, that there were feveral ways of compafling it. But that of them, which I
fhall at prelent mention, was this : having diftilled a quantity of box-wood per ft, and
flowly rectified the fourifh fpirit, the better to free it both from oil and phlegm, I
caft into this rectified liquor a convenient quantity of powdered coral, expecting that
the acid part of the liquor would corrode the coral, and being aflbciated with it,
would be fo retaineil by it, that the other part of the liquor, which was not of an
acid nature, nor fit to fallen upon the corals, would be permitte d to afcend alone.
Nor was I deceived in my expectation ; for having gently abftracted the liquor from
the ror.'ls, there c;'me over a tpirit of a ftrong fmell, and of a taftc very piercing, but
without any fourncis •, and which was in divers qualities manifcftly different, not only
from a fpirit of vinegar, but from fome fpirit ot the fame wood, that I purpofely kept
by me without depriving it of its acid ingredient. And to fatisfy you, that thefe two
fuUlanccs were ol'a very differing nature, I might inform you of feveral trials, that I
made, but mult not name tome of them, becaule I cannot do fo without making
fome unieafonable difcovrries. Yet this I fhall te 11 you at prcfent, that the four
fpirit of box not only would, as I juft now relate:l, diffolvc corals, which the otner
would not fatten on, but being poured upon fait of tartar, would immediately b >il

and hift, whereas the other would lie quietly upon ft. The acid fpirit poured upon
minium made a fugar of lead, which I did not rind the other to do : fome drops of
this penetrant fpirit being mingled with fome drops of the blue fyrup of violets,
ieemed rather to dilute, than othcrwife alter the colour-, whereas the acid fpirit
turned the fyrup of a rcddilh colour, and would probably have made it of as pure a
red, as acid falts are wont to do, had not its operation been hindered by the mixture
of the other fpirit. A few drops of the compound fpirit being fhaken into a pretty
quantity of the infufion of lignum nephriticum, prefently deitroyed all the bluilh
colour, whereas the other fpirit would not take it away. To all which it might be
added, that having for trial's fake poured fair water upon the corals, that remained
in the bottom of the glafs, wherein I had rectified the double fpirit (if I may fo call
it) that was firll drawn from the box, I found, according to my expectation, that the
acid fpirit had really diflblved the corals, and had coagulated with them. For by
the affufion of fair water, I obtained a folution, which (to note that Angularity upon
the by) was red, whence the water being evaporated, there remained a foluble iubftance
much like the ordinary fait of coral, as chymilts are pleafed to call that magiftery
of corals, which they make by diffolving them in common fpirit of vinegar,
and abftracling the menftruum ad ficcitatem. I know not whether I Ihould fubjoin on
this occafion, that the fimple fpirit of box, if chymifts will have it therefore faline
becaufe it has a ftrong tafte, will furnifh us with a new kind of faline bodies, differing
from thole .hitherto taken notice of. For whereas of the three chief forts of falts,
the acid, the alcalizate, and the fulphureous, there is none, that feerrs to be friends
with both the other two, as I may, ere it be long, have occafion to Ihew ; I did
not find, but that the fimple fpirit of box did agree very well (at lead as far as I had
occafion to try it) both with the acid and the other falts. For though it would lie
very quiet with fait of tartar, fpirit of urine, or other bodies, whofe falts were either
of an alcalizare or fugitive nature; yet did not the mingling of oil of vitriol itfelf
produce any biffing or cfiervelcence, which you know is wont to enfue upon the
affufion of that highly acid liquor upon either of the bodies newly mentioned
I think myfelf, (fays Elcutberius) beholden to you for this experiment \ not only,
becaufe I forefee you will make it helpful to you in the enquiry you are now upon,
but becaufe it teaches us a method, whereby we may prepare a numerous fort of new
fbirits, which though more fimple than any that are thought elementary, are manileftly
endowed with peculiar and powerful qualities, fome of which may probably
be of confiderable ufe in phyfick, as well alone as alTociatcd with other things j as
one may hopefully guels by the rednefs of that folution your four fpirit made of corals,

I have not yet tried (fays Carneades) of what ufe the mentioned liquors may be in
phyfic, either as medicines or as menftruums : but I could mention now (and may
another time) divers of the trials, that I made to fausfy myfelf of the difference o'f
thefe two liquors. But that, as I allow your thinking what you newly told me about
corah, 1 preiume you will allow me, from what I have laid already, to deduce this
coroftary j that there arc divers compound bodies, which may be rcfolvcd into four
filch differing lubitaaces, as may as well merit the uamc of principles, as thole to
which.

which the chymifts freely give it. For fince they fcruple not to reckon that, which
I call the compound fpirit of box, for the fpirit, or, as others would have it, the
mercury of that wood j I fee not, why the acid liquor, and the other, Ihould nor
each of them, efpecially that laft named, be looked upon as more worthy to be called
an elementary principle ; fince it muft needs be of a more fimple nature than the
liquor, which was found to be divifible into that, and the acid fpirit. And this further
ufe (continues Carneadts) may be made of our experiment to my prefent purpofe,
that it may give us a rife to fufpeft, that fince a liquor reputed, by the chymifts
to be, without difpute, homogeneous, is, by fo flight a way, divifible into two diftinft
and more fimple ingredients, fome more fkilful or happier experimenter than I,
may find a way either further to divide one of thefe fpirits, or to folve fome or other,
if not all, of thofc other ingredients of mixt bodies, that have hitherto paflcd among
chymifts for their elements or principles.
THE
SCEPTICAL CHYMIST:
PART IV.
AND thus much (fays Carneades) may fuffice to be faid of the number of the
diftir t fubftanccs feparable from mixt bodies by the fire : wherefore I now proceed
to confider the nature of them, and fhew you, that though they feein homogeneous
bodies, yet have they not the purity and fimplicity that is rcquifite to elements ; and I
fiiould immediately proceed to the proof of my afiertion, but that the confidence,
wherewith chymifts arc wont to call each of the fubftances we fpeak of by the name
of fulphur or mercury, or the other of the hypoftatical principles, and the intolerable
ambiguity they allow themfelves in their writings and expreflions, makes it neceflary
for me, in order to the keeping you either from miftaking me, or thinking I miftake
the controvert)-, to take notice to you, and complain of the unrcalbnable liberty they
give themfelves of playing with names at pleauire. And indeed if I were obliged
in this difpute, to have fuch regard to the phrafeology of each particular chymift,
as not to write any thing, which this or that author may not pretend, not to contradict
this or that fenfc, which he may give us as occafion ferves to his ambiguous
expreflions, I fhould fcarce know how to difpute, nor which way to turn myfelfT For
I find that even eminent writers (fuch as Raymund Lulfy, Paraeelfeu, and others) do
fo abufe the terms they employ, that as they will now and then give divers things one
name ; fo they will oftentimes give one thing many names ; and fome of them (perhaps)

and fometimes the mercury of a body. And now I fpeak of mercury, I cannot but
take notice, that the defcriptions they give us of that principle or ingredient of mixt
bodies, are fo intricate, that even thofe, that have endeavoured to pohlh and illuftrate
the notions of the chymifts, are fain to confefs, that they know not what to make of
it either by ingenuous acknowledgments, or defcriptions, that are not intelligible.
I must confefs (fays Eleutberius) I have in the reading of Paracel/us, and other
chymical authors, been troubled to find, that fuch hard words and equivocal exprcffions,
as you juftly complain of, do, even when they treat of principles, feem to be
ftudioufly affecled by thofe writers ; whether to make themfelves to be admired by
their readers, and their art appear more venerable and myfterious, or (as they would
have us think) to conceal from them a knowledge themfelves judge ineftimable.
But whatever (fays Carneades) thefe men may promife themfelves from a canting
way of delivering the principles of nature, they will find the major part of knowing
men fo vain, as when they underftand not what they read, to conclude, that it is
rather the writer's fault than their own. And thofe, that are fo ambitious to be admired
by the vulgar, that rather than go without the admiration of the ignorant they
will expofe themfelves to the contempt of the learned, thofe fhall, by my confent,
freely enjoy their option. As for the myftical writers fcrupling to communicate their
knowledge, they might lefs to their own difparagement, and to the trouble of their
readers, have concealed it by writing no books, than by writing bad ones. If 'tbemiflius
were here, he would not ftick to fay, that chymifts write thus darkly, not bccaufe
they think their notions too precious to be explained, but becaufe they fear, that
if they were explained, men would difcern, that they are far from being precious.
And indeed I fear, that the chief reafon, why chymifts have written fo obicurcly of
their three principles, may be, that not having clear and diftindr. notions of them
themfelves, they cannot write otherwife than confufedly of what they but confufedly
apprehend : not to fay, that divers of them, being confeious to the invalidity of
their doctrine, might well enough difcern, that they could fcarce keep themfelves
from being confuted, but by keeping themfelves from being clearly underflood.
But though much may be laid to excufe the chymifts when they write
darkly, and :enigmatically, about the preparation of their elixir, and fome few
other grand arcana, the divulging of which they may, upon grounds plaufible
enough, efteem unfit; yet when they pretend to teach the general principles of
natural philofophcrs, this equivocal way of writing is not to be endured. For in
fuch fpeculative enquiries, where the naked knowledge of the truth is the thing principally
aimed at, what docs he teach me worth thanks, that does not, if he can,
make his notion intelligible to me, but by myftical terms, and ambiguous phrafes
darkens what he fhould clear up •, and makes me add the trouble of guefling at the
fenfe of what he equivocally exprefTes, to that of examining the truth of what he
feems to deliver ? And if the matter of the philofophcr's ftonc, and the manner of
preparing it, be fuch myfteries, as they would have the world believe them, they may
write intelligibly and clearly of the principles of mixt bodies in general, without discovering
what they call the great work. But for my part (continues Carneades) what
my indignation at this un-philofophical way of teaching principles has now extorted
from me, is meant chiefly to excufe myfelf, if I (hall hereafter oppofc any particular
opinion or aficrtion, that fome follower of Paracelfus or any eminent artift may pretend
not to be his mailer's. For, as I told you long fince, I am not obliged to examine
private men's writings (which were a labour as cndlefs as unprofitable) being
only engaged to examine thofe opinions about the tria prima* which I find thofe chymifts
1 have met with to agree in moft : and I doubt not, but my arguments agair.ft
Vol. I. X x x their
5 22 The Sceptical Chymist/
their doctrine will be in great part eafily enough applicable even to thofe private opinions,
which they do not fo directly and cxprefsly oppofc. And indeed, that, which
I am now entering upon, being the confideration of the things themfelves, whereinto
Spagyrifts refolve mixt bodies by the fire, if I can fhew, that theie are not of an elementary
nature, it will be no great matter what names thefe or thofe chymifts have
been pleafed to give them. And I queftion not, that to a wife man, and confequendy
to EUutberius, it will be lefs confidcrablc to know, what men have thought of things,
than wh-t they mould have thought.
In the fourth and laft place, then, I confider, that as generally as chymifts are
wont to appeal to experience, and as confidently as they ufe to inftance the feveral
fubftances feparated by the fire from a mixt body, as a fufficient proof of their being
its component elements ; yet thofe differing fubftances are many of them far enough
from elementary fimplicity, and may be yet looked upon as mixt bodies, moft of
them alfo retaining, fomcwhat at leaft, if not very much,- of the nature of thofe concretes
whence they were forced. I am glad (fays Eleutberiui) to fee the vanity or envy,
of the canting chymifts thus difcovered and chaftifed •, and I could with, that learned
men would confpire together to make thefe deluding writers fenfiblc, that they muft
no longer hope with impunity to abufe the world. For whilft fuch men are quietly
permitted to publifti books with promifing titles, and therein to aflert what they pleafe,
and contradict others, and even themfelves as they pleafe, with as litde danger of
being confuted as of being underftood, they are encouraged to get themfelves a
name, at the coft of the readers, by finding, that intelligent men are wont, for the
reafon newly mentioned,, to let their books and them alone : and the ignorant and
credulous (of which the number is fl ill much greater than that of the other) are forward
to admire moft what they leaft underftand. But if judicious men, (killed in,
chymical affairs, fliall once agree to write clearly and plainly of them, and thereby
keep men from being ftunned, as it were, or impofed upon by dark or empty words j.
it is to be hoped, that thefe men finding, that they can no longer write impertinently
and abfurdly, without being laughed at for doing fo, will be reduced either to write
nothing, or books, that may teach us fomething, and not rob men, as formerly, of
invaluable time and fo ceafing to trouble the world with riddles or impertinencies,,
we lhall either by their books receive an advantage, or by their filence efcapc an in*
convenience.
But after all this is faid (continues Eleuiherius) it may be reprcfented in favour of.
the chymifts, that, in one regard the liberty they take in ufing names, if it be cxcufable
at any time, may be more fo when they fpeak of the fubflances, whereinto.
their analylis rclblves mixt bodies : fince as parents have the right to name their own.
children, it has ever been allowed to the authors of new inventions, to impole names
upon them. And therefore the fubjects we fpeak of being fo the productions of the
chymifts art, as <ior to be otherwife, but by it, obtainable •, it feems but equitable to
give the aitiils leave to name them as they pleafe : confidcring alfo, that none are fo
fit and likely to teach us what thofe bodies are, as they to whom we owed them.
I told you already (fays Carneades) that there is great difference betwixt the being
able to make experiments, and the being able to give a philofophical account of them.
And I will noi now add, that many a mine-digger may meet, whilft he follows his
work, with a gem or a mineral which he knows not what to make of, till he fliews it
a jeweller or a mineralift to be informed what it is. But that which I would rather
have here obferved, is, that the chymifts I am now in debate with have given up the
liberty you challenged for them, of ufing names at pleafure, and confined thcmlelves

'by their defcriptions, though but fuch as they are, of their principles ; fo that although
they might freely have called any thing their analyfis prelencs them with,
cither fulphur, or mercury, or gas, or bias, or what they plcaicd ; yet when they
have told me, that fulphur (for inftance) is a primogeneal and fimple body, inflammable,
odorous, &V. they muft give me leave to difbelicvc them, if they tell me,
that a body, that is cither compounded or uninflammable, is fuch a fulphur \ and to
think they play with words, when they teach, that gold and fome other minerals
abound with an incombuftible fulphur, which is as proper an expreflion, as a funfhine
night, or a fluid ice.
But before I defcend to the mention of particulars belonging to my fourth confideration,
I think it convenient to premife a few generals ; fome of which I (hall the
fcfs need to infift on at prefent, becaufc I have touched on them already.
And firft I muft invite you to take notice of a certain paflage in Helmcnt • ; which
diough 1 have not found much heeded by his readers, he himielf mentions as a notable
thing, and I take to be a very confiderable one : for whereas the diflilled oilolive,
though drawn per fe, is (as I have tried) of a very (harp and fretting quality,
and of an odious tafte, he tells us, that fimple oil being only digefted with Paracelfufsfid
cireulatum, is reduced into diflimilar parts, and yields a fweet oil, very differing
from the oil diftilled from fallet oil i as alfo, that by the fame way there may be
Hcparated from wine a very fweet and gentle fpirit, partaking of a far other and
nobler quality than that which is immediately drawn by diftifiation, and called dcphlegmcd
aqua vitae, from whofe acrimony this other fpirit is exceedingly remote
;
although thefal circulation that makes thefe anatomies be feparated from the analyzed
bodies, in the fame weight and with the fame qualities it had before. Which affirmation
of Helmcnt, if we admit to be true, we muft acknowledge, that there may be
a very great difparity betwixt bodies of the fame denomination (as feveral oils, or feveral
fpirits) feparablc from compound bodies : for befides the differences I (hall
anon take notice of, betwixt thoie diftilled oils that are commonly known to chymifts,
it appears by this, that by means of the fal ciratlatum, there may be quite another
fort of oils obtained from the fame body : and who knows, but that there may be
yet other agents bound in nature, by whofc help there may, whether by tranfmutation
or otherwife, be obtained from the bodies vulgarly called mixt, oils or other fubftances,
differing from thofe of the fame denomination, known either to vulgar chymifts,
or even to Helmcnt himfelf ? But for fear you fhould tell me, that this is but a
conjecture grounded upon another man's relation, whofe truth we have not the means
to experiment, I will not infift upon it ; but leaving you to confider of it at leifure,
1 fhall proceed to what is next.
Secondly, then, if that be true, which was the opinion of Leucippus, Bemocritus,
and other prime anatomifts of old, and is in our days revived by no mean philofophers
•, namely, that our culinary fire, fuch as chymifts ufc, confifts of lwarms of
little bodies fwiftly moving, which by their fmallnefs and motion are able to permeate

the fol'tdcft and compafleft bodies, and even glafs kfelf ; if this (I fay) be true, fine*
we fee, Out in flints and other concretes, the fiery part is incorporated with the
grofler, it will not be irrational to conje&ure, that multitudes of thefe fiery corpufcles,
getting in at the pores of the glaJi, may aiTociate themfelves with the parts of the
mixt body whereon they work, and with them conftitute new kinds of compound
bodies, according as the ft ape, fize, and other affections of the parts of the diflipated
body happen to difpofe them, in reference to fuch combinations ; of which alto there
may be the greater number, if it be likewife granted, that the corpufcles of the fire,
though all exceeding minute, and very fwiftly moved, are not all of the fame bignefs,
nor figure : and if I had not weightier confiderations to difcourfe to you of, I
could name to you, to countenance what I have newly faid, fome particular experiments,
by which I have been induced to think, that the particles of an open fire
working upon fome bodies may really afibciate themfelves therewith, and add to the
quantity. But becaufe I am not fure, that when the fire works upon bodies included
in glafies, it does it by a real trajedHon of the fiery corpufcles themfelves, through
the Jubilance of the glafs, I will proceed to what is next to be mentioned.
I cou to (fays Eleulberius) help you to fome proofs, whereby I think it may be
made very probable, that when the fire a&s immediately upon a body, fome of its.
corpufcles may ftick to thofe of the burnt body, as they feem to do in quick-lime, hut
in greater numbers and more permanently. But for fear of retarding your progrels,
I mail defire you to defer this inquiry till another time, and proceed as you intended.
You may then, in the next place (fays Cariteades) obferve with me, that not only
there are fome bodies, as gold and filver, which do not by the ufual examens, made
by fire, difcovcr themfelves to be mixt , but if (as you may remember I formerly told
you) it be a de-compound body, that is diflipable into feveral fubftances, by being
expofed to the fire it may be refolved into fuch, as are neither elementary, nor fuch as
it was upon its laft mixture compounded of -, but into new kinds of mixts. Of this.
I have already given you fome examples in foap, fugar of lead, and vitriol. Now if
wc lhall confider, that there are fome bodies, as well natural (as that I laft named)
as factitious, manifcflly de-compounded', that in the bowels of the earth nature may,.
s;s we fee flie fometimts does* make ftrange mixtures ; that animals are nourilbed
with other animals and plants •„ and that thefe themfelves have almoft all of them
their nutriment and growth, either from a certain nitrous juice harboured in the pores
of the earth, or from the excrements of animals, or from the pucrified bodies, either
of living creatures or vegetables, or from other fubftances of a compounded nature v
if, I fay, we confider this, it may feem probable, that there may be among the
works of nature (not to mention thofe of art) a greater number of de-compound
bodies, than men take notice of; and indeed, as I have formerly alto obierved, it
decs not at all appear, that all mixtures muft be of elementary bodies ; but it feem*
f;r more probable, that there are divers forts of compound bodies, even in. regard of
all or fome of their ingredients, confidered antecedently to their mixture. For
though fome feem to be made up by the immediate coalitions of the elements, or.
principles themfelves, and therefore may be called prima mijla, or mifia primaria ; yec
if. leetr.s, that many other bodies are mingled (if 1 may fo fpeak) at the fecond hand,
their immediate ingredients being not elementary, but thefe primary mixt newly fpokers
of; ar.d from divers of thofe fecondary forts of mixt may refult, by a further compofition,
a third fort, and fo onwards. Nor is it improbable, that fome bodies arc
made up of mixt bodies, not all of the fame order* but of fcvcral; as (for inftance)

a concrete may confift of ingredients, thereof the one may have been a primary, the
other a fecondary mixt body j (as I have in native cinnaber, by my way of refolving
it, found both that coarfer part, that feems more properly to be ore, and a combultible
fulphur, and a running mercury :) or perhaps without any ingredient of this
latter fort, it may be compofed of mixt bodies, fome of them of the firft, and fome
of the third kind. And this may perhaps be fomewhat illuftrated by reflecting upon
what happens in fome chymical preparations of thofe medicines which they call their
bezoardicums. For firft, they take antimony and iron, which may be looked upon
as prima mifta\ of thefe they compound a ftarry regulus, and to this they add, according
to their intention, either gold or filver, which makes with it a new and further
compofition. To this they add fublimate, which is itfelf a de-compound body
(confuting of common quickfiiver, and divers falts united by fublimation into a'
cryftalline fubftance) and from this fublimate, and the other metalline mixtures, they
draw a liquor, which may be allowed to be of a yet more compounded nature. If
it be true, as chymifts affirm it, that by this art fome of the gold or filver mingled
with the regulus may be carried over the helm with it by the fublimate , as indeed a
flcilful and candid perfon complained to me a while fincc, that an experienced friend
of his and mine, having by fuch a way brought over a great deal of gold, in hope to
do foinething further with it, which might be gainful to him, has not only milled of
his aim, but is unable to recover his volatilized gold out of the antimonial butter,
wherewith it is ftri&ly united.
Now (continues Carntades ) if a compound body confift of ingredients, that are
not merely elementary ; it is not hard to conceive, that the fubftances, into which
the fire diflblves it, though feemingly homogeneous enough, may be of a compounded
nature, thofe parts of each body, that are moft of kin, aflbciating thcmfelves into a
compound of a new kind. As when (for example fake) 1 have cauied vitriol and fal
armoniac, and ialt-petre to be mingled and diftilled together, the liquor, thatcame
over, manifefted itfelf not to be either fpiria of nitre, or of fal armoniac, or of vitriol.
For none of thefe would diflblve crude gold, which yet my liquor was able
readily to do j and thereby manifefted itfelf to be a new compound, confifting at
leaft of fpirit of nitre, and fal armoniac (for the latter diflblved in the former, will
work on gold) which neverthelets are not by any known way feparable, and confequently
would not pafs for a mixt body, if we ourfelves did not, to obtain it, put and -
diftil together divers concretes, whofe diftintt operations were known beforehand.
And to add on this occafion the experiment I lately promifed you, becaufe it is applicable
to our preient purpofc, I ftiall acquaint you, that lufpetting the common oil
of vitriol not to be altogether fuch a fimple liquor, as chymifts prefume it, I mingled
it with an equal or a double quantity (for I tried the experiment more than once) of
common oil of turpentine, fuch as- together with the other liquor I bought at the
drugfters. And' having carefully (for the experiment is nice, and fomewhat dangerous)
diftilled the mixture in a fmall glafs retort, 1 obtained, according to my defire,
(befides the two liquors I hail put in) a pretty quantity of a' certain fubftance, which
ftickiog all about the neck of the retort* dilcovcred itfelf to be fulphur, not only by
a- very ftrong fulphureous fmelk and by the colour of brimftone ; but alio by this, thbt
being put upon a coal, it was immediately kindled, and burned like common fulphur.
And of this fubftance I have yet by mc fome little parcels^ which you may command
and examine when you pleafe. So that from this experiment I may deduce either,
one, or both of thefe propofitions, that a real fulphur may be made by the conjunction
of two fuch. liibftanees as. chymifts, take for elementary,, andwhich did not cither *
7%e Sceptical Chymist.
of them apart appear to have any fuch body in it ; or, that oil of vitnol, though a
diftilled liquor, and taken for part of the falmc principle of the concrete, that yields
it, may yet be fo compounded a body, as to contain, befide its faline part, a fulphur
like common brimftone, which would hardly be itfelf a fimple or un-compoundcd
body.
I might (purfues Camtades) remind you, that I formerly reprefcnted it as poflible,
that as there may be more elements than five, or fix j fo the elements of one body
may be different from thofe of another : whence it would follow, that from the refolution
of de-compound bodies there may refult mixts of an altogether new kind,
by the coalition of elements, that never perhaps convened before. I might, I fay,
mind you of this, and add divers things to this lecond confideration ; but for fear of
wanting time, I willingly pretermit them, to pafs on to the third, which is this, that
the fire docs not always barely refolve or take afunder, but may alfo after a new manner
mingle and compound together the parts (whether elementary or not) of the body
diflipated by it.
This is fo evident (fays Carneades) in fome obvious examples, that I cannot but
wonder at their fupinenefs, that have not taken notice of it. For when wood being
burnt in a chimney is diflipated by the fire into fmoke and afhes, that fmoke compofes
foot, which is fo far from being any one of the principles of the wood, that (as
1 noted above) you may by a further anaiyfis feparate five or fix diftinct Jubilances
from it. And as for the remaining afhes, the chymifts themfclves teach us, that by
a further degree of fire they may be indifiblubly united into glafs. It is true, that
the anaiyfis, which the chymifts principally build upon, is made, not in the open
air, but in dofe veffels ; but however, the examples lately produced may invite you
Ihrewdly to fufpect, that heat may as well compound as diffipate the parts of mixt
bodies : and not to tell you, that I have known a vitrification made even in clofe veffels,
I muft remind you, that the flowers of antimony, and thofe of fulphur, are
very mixt bodies, though they afcend in clofe veffels and that it was in ftopt glaffes,
that I brought up the whole body of camphire. And whereas it may be objected,
that all thefe examples are of bodies forced up in a dry, not a fluid form, as are the
liquors wont to be obtained by dift illation ; I anfwer, that befides it is poflible, that
a body may be changed from confident to fluid, or from fluid to confident, without
being otherwifc much altered, as may appear by the eafinefs, wherewith in
winter, without any addition or feparation of vtfible ingredients, the fame fubftance
may be quickly hardened into brittle ice, and thawed again into fluid water ; befides
this, I fay, it mould be confidercd, that common quickfilvcr itfelf, which the emincntcft
chymifts confefs to be a mutt body, may be driven over the helm in its priftine
form of quickfilvcr, and confequently, in that of a liquor. And certainly it is poffible,
that very compounded bodies may concur to conftitute liquors ; fince, not to
mention, that 1 have found it poflible, by the help of a certain menftruum, to diftil
gold itfelf through a retort, even with a moderate fire; let us but confider what
happens in butter of antimony. For if that be carefully rectified, it may be reduced
into a very clear liquor ; and yet if you caft a quantity of fair water upon it, there

brought to concur to conftitute diftilled liquors and alfo, that you may not imagine,
with divers learned men, that pretend no fmall (kill in chymiftry, that at leaft no
mixt body can be brought over the helm, but by corrofive falts ; I am ready to fhew
you, when you pleafe, among ocher ways of bringing over flowers of brimftone (perhaps
I might add, even mineral fulphurs) fome, wherein I employ none but oleaginous
bodies to make volatile liquors, in which not only the colour, but (which is a
much furer mark) the fmell and fome operations manifelt, that there is brought over
a fulphur, that makes part of the liquor.
One thing more there is, Ekutberius (lays Carneades) which is fo pertinent to my
prcfent purpoie, that, though I have touched upon it before, I cannot but on this
occafion take notice of it. And it is this •, that the qualities or accidents, upon
whofe account chymifts are wont to call a portion of matter by the name of mercury^
or fome other of their principles, are not fuch, buc that it is poflible as great (and
therefore why not the lute ?) may be produced by fuch changes of texture, and other
alterations, as the fire may make in the fmall parts of a body. I have already proved,
when I difcourfed of the fecond general confideration, by what happens to plants
nourifhed only with fair water, and eggs hatched into chickens, that by changing the
difpofition of the component parts of a body, nature is able to effect as great changes
in a parcel of matter reputed fimilar, as thofe requifitc to denominate one of the
tria prima. And, though Helmont do fomewhere wittily call the fire the deftrudtor
and the artificial death of things ; and, although another eminent chymift and phyflcian
be pleated to build upon this, that fire can never generate any thing but fire j
yet you will, I doubt not, be of another mind, if you confidcr, hdV many new forts
of mixed bodies chymifts themfelves have produced by means of the fire •, and particularly,
if you confider, how that noble and permanent body, glafs, is not only
manifeftly produced by the violent action of the fire, but has never, for aught we
know, been produced any other way. And, indeed, it feems but an inconfideratcr
afiertion of lome Helmontians, that every fort of body of a peculiar denominationmult
be produced by fome feminal power ; as I think 1 could evince, if I thought ic
fo neceflary, as it is for me to haften to what 1 have further to difcourfe. Norjiecd
it much move us, that there are fome, who look upon wharfoever the fire is employed
to produce, not as upon natural, but artificial bodies. For there is not always
fuch a difFcrence, as many imagine, betwixt the one and the other ; nor is it fo cafy a*
they think, clearly to aflign that, which properly, conftantly, and fufficiently, difcriminates
them. But not to engage myfelf in fo nice a difquifition, it may now fuffice
to obferve, that a thing is commonly termed artificial, when a parcel of matter
is by the artificer's hand, or tools, or both, brought to fuch a fhape or form, as he
defigncd before-hand in his mind : whereas in many of the chymical productions the
effect would be produced, whether the artificer intended it or no •, and is oftentimes;
very much other than he intended or looked for : and the inftrumenrs employed are
not tools artificially fafhioned and fhaped, like thofc of tradel'men, for diis or that
particular work ; but, for the molt part, agents of nature's own providing, and
whofe chief powers of operation diey receive from their own nature or texture, not
the artificer. And, indeed, the fire is as well a natural agent as Iced : and the chymilt
that employs it, does but apply natural agents and patients, who being thus,
brought together, and acting according to their respective natures, perform the work.

I was going to lay •, you may obferve with me, Eleutberius, that, as I told you once
before, qualities flight enough may ferve to denominate a chymical principle. For,
when they anatomize a compound body by the fire, if they get a fubtlance inflammable,
and that will not mingle with water, that they prefently call fulphur , what is
fapid and diflbluble in water, that muft pafs for fait ; whatfoever is fixed and indiffoluble
in water, that they name earth. And I was going to add, that whatfoever volatile
fubftancc they know not what to make of, not to lay, whatfoever they pleafe,
that they call mercury. But that thefe qualities may either be produced, othcrwife
than by fuch as they call feminal agents, or may belong to bodies of a compounded
nature, may be Jhewn, among other inftances, in glafs made of afhes, where the exceeding
ftrong-tafted alcalizate fait joining with the earth becomes infipid, and with
it conltitutes a body ; which, though alfo dry, fixed and indiffoluble in water, is yet
manifeftly a mixed body j and made lb by the fire itfelf.
And I remember to our prefent purpofe, that Hclmont, amongft: other medicines
that he commends, has a Ihort procels, wherein, though the directions for practice
are but obfeurely inumated, yet I have fome reafon not to dilbelieve the procefs,
without affirming or denying any tiling about the virtues of the remedy to be made

A not unlike procefs he delivers in another place ; from whence, if we fuppofc him
to fay true, I may argue, that lince by the fire there may be produced a fubftance,
that is as well falme and volatile, as the fait of hartfhorn, blood, &c. which pafs for
elementary j and fincc that this volatile fait is really compounded of a chymical oil
and a fixed fait, the one made volatile by the other, and both afibciated by the fire, it
may well be fufpected, that other fubflances, emerging upon the diflipation of bodies
by the fire, may be new forts of mix ts, and confift of fubftances of differing natures
and particularly, I have fomctimcs fufpected, that fince the volatile falts of blood,
hartlnorn, &rV. are fugitive, and endowed with an exceeding ftrong fmell, either that
thynjifts do erroneoully afcribe all odours to fulphurs, or that luch falts confift of
Jomc oily parts well incorporated with the faline ones. And the like conjecture I
have alfo made concerning fpirit of vinegar, which though the chymifts think one of
the principles of that body, and though being an acid fpirit it feems to be much lefs
or kin, than volatile falts, to fulphurs ; yet, not to mention its piercing fmell, which
I know not with what congruity the chymifts will deduce from fait, I wonder they

teH you, how differing a thing I did, upon examination, find the caput mortuum, fo
flighted by Btguimu> to be, from what he reprefents it, I believe you would think
the conjecture propofed lefs probable than one or other of thefe three ; either that
this oil did formerly concur to conftitute the fpirit of vinegar, and fo that what paffes
for a chymical principle, may yet be further rcfoluble into diftincl fubftances ; or that
fome parts of the fpirit, together with fome parts of the lead, may conftitute a chymical
oil, which therefore, though it pafs tor homogeneous, may be a very compounded
body ; or at leaft, that by the action of the dialled vinegar and the faturnine
calx one upon another, part of the liquor may be fo altered, as to be tranfmuted
from an acid fpirit into an oil. And though the truth of either of the two former
conjectures would make the example I have reflected on, more pertinent to my
prefent argument yet you'll eafily difcern, the third and laft conjecture cannot be
unferviceable to confirm fome other paffages of my difcourfe.
To return then to what I was faying juft before I mentioned Helnunfs experiment i
I (hall fubjoin, that chymifts muftconfefs alfo, that in the perfectly dephlegmed
fpirit of wine, or other fermented liquors, that, which they call the fulphur of the
concrete, lofes, by the fermentation, the property of oil, (which the chymifts likewife
take to be the true fulphur of the mixt) of being unmingleable with the water.
And if you will credit " Helmottt, a pound of the pureft fpirit of wine may barely,
by the help of pure fait of tartar, (which is but the fixed fait of wine) be refolved or
tranfmuted into fcarce half an ounce of fait, and as much elementary water, as
amounts to the remaining part of the mentioned weight. And it may (as I think I
formerly alfo noted) be doubted, whether that fixed and alcalizate fait, which is fo
unanimoufly agreed on, to be the faline principle of incinerated bodies, be not, as
it is alcalizate, a production of the fire ? For though the tafte of tartar, for example,
feem to argue, that it contains a fait before it be burned ; yet that fait being very
acid, is of a quite differing tafte from the lixiviate fait of calcined tartar. And
though it be not truly objected againft the chymifts, that they obtain all falts they
make, by reducing the body they work on ihto afhes with violent fires, (fince hartfhorn,
amber, blood, and divers other mixts, yield a copious fait-, before they be
burned to afhes) yet this volatile fait differs much, as we fhall fee anon, from the
fixed alcalizate fait I fpeak of; which, for aught I remember, is not producible by
any known way, without incineration. It is not unknown to chymifts, that quickfilvcr
may be precipitated, without addition, into a dry powder, that remains fo in
water. And lome eminent Spagyrifts, and even Raimund Lulfy himfelf, teach, that
mcerly by the fire, quickfilvcr may in convenient veffels be reduced (at leaft in great
part) into a thin liquor like water, and minglcablc with it. So that by the bare
action of the fire, it is poffible, that the parts of a mixed body mould be fo difpofed
after new and differing manners, that it may be fomctimes of one confiftence,
ibmetimes of another i and may in one ftatc be difpofed to be mingled with water,
and in another not. I could alfo fhew you, that bodies, from which apart chymifts
cannot obtain any thing, that is combuftible, may, by being aflbciated together, and
by the help of the fire, afford an inflammable fubftance. And, that on the other
fide, it is pofiiblc for a body to be inflammable, from which it would very much
puzzle any ordinary chymift, and perhaps any other, to fcparate an inflammable
principle or ingredient, Wherefore, fince the principles of chymifts may receive

their denominations from qualities, which it often exceeds not the power of art, nor
always that of the fire to produce •, and it tier fuch qualities may be found in bodies,
that differ fo much in other qualities from one another, that they need not be allowed
to agree in that pure and iimple nature, which principles, to be fo indeed, mull
have; it may juftly be lufpected, that many productions of the fire, that are (hewed
us by chymifts, as the principles of the concrete, that afforded them, may be but a
new kind of mixts. And to annex, on this occafion, to thefe arguments taken from
the nature of the thing, one of thofe, which logicians call ad beminem, I (hall define
you to take notice, that though Paracelfus himfelf, and fome, that are fo miftaken,
as to think he could not be lb, have ventured to teach, that not only the bodie*
here below, but the elements themfelves, and all the other parts of the univerfe,
are compofed of fait, fulphur and mercury ; yet the learned Sevnertus, and all the
more wary chymifts, have rejected that conceit, and do many of them confefs, that
the tria prima are each of them made up of the four elements ; and others of them
make earth and water concur with fait, fulphur and mercury, to the conftitution of
rruxt bodies. So that one fort of thefe Spagyrifts, notwithftanding the fpecious titles
they give to the productions of the fire, do in effect grant what I contend for. And,
of the other fort 1 may well demand, to what kind of bodies the phlegm and dead
earth, to be met with in chymical refolutions, are to be referred ? For either they
muft fay, with Paracelfus, but againft their own conceflions, as well as againft experience,
that thefe arc alfo compofed of the tria prima% whereof they cannot feparate
any one from either of them ; or clfe they muft confefc, that two of the vafteft bodies
here below, earth and water, are neither of them compofed of the tria prima i and
that confequently thofe three are not the univerial, and adequate ingredients, neither
of all fublunary bodies, nor even of all muted bodies.
1 know, that the chief of thefe chymifts reprefent, that though the diftinct fubftances
into which they divide mixt bodies by the fire, are not pure and homogeneous ;
yet fince the four elements, into which the Ariftotclians pretend to refolve the like
bodies by the fame agent, are not fimple neither, as themfelves acknowledge, it is as
allowable for the chymifts to call the one principles, as for the Peripateticks to call
the other elements •, fince in both cafes the impofition of the name is grounded only
upon the predominancy of that element, whofe name is afcribed to it. Nor ftiall I
deny, that this argument of the chymifts is no ill one againft the Ariftotclians. But
what anfwer can it prove to me, who, you know, am diluting as well againft the
Ariftotclian elements, as the chymical principles, and muft not look upon any body
as a true principle or element, but as yet compounded, which is not perfectly homogeneous,
but is further rcfoluble into any number of diftinft fubflances, how fmall
foever ? And as for the chymifts calling a body fait, or fulphur, or mercury, upon
pretence, that the principle of the fame name is predominant in it, that itfelf is
an acknowledgment of what I contend for; namely, that thefe produclions of the
fire are yet compounded bodies. And yet whilft this is granted, it is affirmed, but
not proved, that the reputed fait, or fulphur, or mercury, confifts mainly of one body,
that deferves the name of a principle of the fame denomination. For how do chymifts
make it appear, that there are any fuch primitive and fimple bodies in thofe we are
fpeaking of; fince it is upon the matter confefled by the anfwer lately made, that
thefe are not fuch ? And if they pretend by reafon to evince what they affirm, what
becomes of their confident boafts, that the chymift (whom they therefore, after
Beguinus, call a pbilofopbus or opifex fenfatus) can convince our eyes, by manifeftly
(hewing in any mixt body thofe fimple fubftanccs he teaches them to be cqmpofed of?

And indeed, for the chymifts to have recourfe in this cafe to other proofs than experiments,
as it is to wave the grand argument, that has all this while been given*ut
for a dcmonftrative one i fo it releafes me from the obligation to profccute a difpute,
wherein I am not engaged to examine any but experimental proofs. I know it may
plaufibly enough be reprefcnted, in favour of the chymifts, that it being evident,
that much the greater part of any thing they call fait, or fulphur, or mercury, is
really fuch ; it would be very rigid to deny thofe fubftances the names afcribed them,
only becaufe of fome flight mixture of another body, fince not only the Peripatetic ks
call particular parcels of matter elementary, though they acknowledge, that elements
are not to be any where found pure, at lead here below, and ftncc efpecially there is
a manifcft analogy and rcfemblance betwixt the bodies obtainable by chymical anatomies,
and the principles whofe names are given them ; I have, I fay, confidered that
thefc things may be reprefcnted : but as for what is drawn from the cuftom of the
Peripateucks, I have already told you, that though it may be employed againft them,
yet it is not available againft me, who allow nothing to be an element, that is not
perfectly homogeneous. And whereas it is alledged, that the predominant principle
ought to give a name to the fubftance wherein it abounds ; I anfwer, that that might
much more reafonably be faid, if either we or die chymifts had feen nature take pure
fait, pure fulphur, and pure mercury, and compound of them every fort of mixt
bodies. But, fince it is to experience that they appeal, we muft not take it for
granted, that the diftilled oil (for inftance) of a plant is mainly compofed of the pure
principle called fulphur, till they have given us an ocular proof, that there is in that
fort of plants fuch an homogeneous fulphur. For as for the fpecious argument,
which is drawn from the rcfemblance betwixt the productions of the fire, and the
refpeitive, either Ariftotelian elements, or chymical prinicples, by whofe names
they are called -
y it will appear more plaufible. than cogent, if you will but recall to
mind the 11 ace of the comroverfy; which is not, whether or no there be obtained
from mixt bodies certain fubftances, that agree in outward appearance, or in fome
qualities, with quickfilver or brimftonc, or fome fuch obvious or copious body j
but whether or no all bodies, confefled to be perfectly mixt, were compofed of, and
are refoluble into a determinate number of primary unmixt bodies. For, if you
keep the ftate of the queftion in your eye, you will eafily difcern, that there is much
pf what ftiould be demonftrated, left unproved by thofe chymical experiments we are
examining. But (not to repeat what 1 have already difcovercd more at large) I Ihall
now take notice, that it will not prefently follow, chat becaufe a production of the
fire has fome affinity with fome of the greater inafles of matter here below, that therefore
they are both of the fame nature, and deferve the lame name ; for the chymifts
are not content, that flame be looked upon as a parcel of the element of fire, though
it be hot, dry, and active, becaufe it wants fome other qualities belonging to the
nature of elementary fire. Nor will they let the Peripateucks call afties, or quicklime,
earth, notwithftanding the many likeneflcs between them ; becaufe thty are
not taftelefs, as elementary earth ought to be : but if you ftiould alk me, what then
it is, that all the chymical anatomies of bodies do prove, if they prove not, that
they confift of the three principles into which the fire relblves them ; 1 anfwer, that
their difle&ions may be granted to prove, that fome mixt bodies (for in many it
will not hold) are by the fire, when they are included in clofc veflels, (for that condition
alfo is often rcquifitc) difioluble into feveral fubftances differing in fome qualities,
but principally in confidence. So that out of moft of them may be obtained a

fixt fubftance, partly falinc, and partly inlipid, an unctuous liquor, and another
liquor, or more, that without being unttuous have a manifeft tafte. Now, if chymifts
will agree to call the dry and lapid fubftance, falf v the unftuous liquor fulphur
and the other, mercury •, I- (hall- not much quarrel with them for fo doing : out if
they will tell me, th'at fait, fulphur, and mercury are fimple and primary bodies,,
whereof each mixt body was a&uaHy compounded, and which was really in it antecedently
to the operation of the fire, they muft give me leave to doubt, whether (whatever
their othei* arguments may do) their experiments prove all this. And if they
will alfo tell me, that the fubftances their anatomies are wont to afford them, are
pure and fimilar, as principles ought to be, they muft give me leave to believe my
own fenfes, and their own confeffions, before their bare afTertions. And that you
may not (EltHtberius) think I deal fo rigidly wkh them, becaufe I fcruple to take
thefe productions of the fire for fuch, as the chymifts would have them pals for, upon
the account of their having fome affinity with them j confider a little with me, that in
regard an element or nrinciplc ought to be perfectly fimilar and homogeneous, there
is no juft caufe, why I fhould rather give the body propoied the name of this or that
element or principle, becaufe it has a refcmblance to it in fome obvious quality, rather
than deny it that name upon the account of divers other qualities, wherein the
propofed bodies are unlike; and if you do but confider, what flight and eafily producible
qualities they are, that fuffice, as I have already more than once obferved, to
denominate a chymical principle or an element, you will not, I hope, think my
warinefs to be deftitute either of example, or elfe of rcafon. For we fee, that the
chymifts will not allow the Ariftotclians, that the fait in afhes ought to be called
earth, thougtv the faiine and terreftrial part fymbolize in weight, in drynefs, in fixed*
nefs and fufibility, only becaufe the one is fapid and diflbluble in water, and the
other not : befidesj we fee that fapidnefs and volatility are wont to denominate the
chymifts mercury or fpirit; and yet how many bodies, think you, may agree in thofe
qualities, which may yet be of very differing natures, and difagree in qualities either
more numerous, or more confiderable, or both? For not only fpirit of nitre, aquafortis,
fpirit of fair, fpirit of oil of vitriol, fpirit of alum, fpirit of vinegar, and all -
faiine liquors diftillcd from animal bodies, but all the acetous fpirits of woods freed
from their vinegar j all thefe, I fay, and many ethers muft belong to the chymiftsmercury,
though it appear not, why fome of them fhould more be comprehended
under one denomination than the chymifts fulphur, or oil, fhould likewife be ; for
their diftillcd oils are alfo fluid, volatile, and taftcablc, as well as their mercury :
-
nor is it neceflary, that their fulphur fhould be unctuous or diflbluble in water, finco
they generally refer fpirit of wine to fulphure, although that fpirit be not unctuous,
and will freely mingle with water. So that bare inflammability muft conftitute the
effence of the chymifts fulphur ; as uninflammabknefs, jointd with any tafte, is enough?
to intitle a diftillcd liquor to be their mercury. Now fince I can further oblerve to
ycu, that fpirit of nitre and fpirit of hart (horn being poured together will boil and
hif», and tols up one another into the air, which the chymifts make figns of great
antipathy in the natures of bodies, (as indeed thefe fpirits differ much both in tafte,,
fmell, and operations) fince I cllcwhere tell you of my having made two forts of oil
out of ihe fame man's blood, that would not mingle with one another ; and fince I
might tell you divers examples I have met with, of the contrariety of bodies, which
according to the chymifts muft be huddled up together under one denomination •, 1

flight qualities, and yet difagree in others more confiderable, are more worthy td
be called by the name of a principle (which ought to be pure and homogeneous)
than to have appellations given them, that may make them differ, in name too, from
the bodies from which they fo widely differ in nature. And hence alio, by the by,
you may perceive, that it is nor unreafonable to diftruft the chymifts way of argumentation,
when being unable to fhew us, that fuch a liquor is (for example) purely
faline, they prove, that at leaft fait is much the predominant principle, becaufe
that the propofed fubftance is ftrongly tailed, and all tafte proceeds trom fait ; whereas
thole fpirits, fuch as fpirit of tartar, fpirit of hartfhorn, and the like, which are reckoned
to be the mercuries of the bodies, that afford them, have manifcftly a ftrong and
piercing tafte, and fo has (according to what I formerly noted) the fpirit of box &c.
even after the acid liquor that concurred to compofe it has been feparated from it.
And indeed, if fapidnefs belong not to the fpirit or mercurial principle of vegetables
and animals, I fcarce know how it will be diferiminated from their phlegm j fined
by the abfence of inflammability it muft be diftinguifhed from their fulphur: which
affords me another example, to prove how unaccurate the chymical doctrine is in our
prefent cafe •, fince not only the fpirit of vegetables and animals, bat their oils are
very ftrongly tafted, as he, that ftiall but wet his tongue with chymical oil of cinnamon
or of cloves, or* even turpentine, may quickly find, to his fmart. And not only
I never tried any chymical oils, whofe tafte was not very manifeft and ftrong ; but a-
Ikilful and inquifitive perfon, who made if his bufinefs by elaborate operations to
depurate chymical oils, and reduce them to an elementary fimplicity, informs us,
that he never was able to make therrr at all taftelefs : whence I might infer, that the
proof chymifts confidently give us of a body's being faline, is fo far from demonftrating
the predominancy, that it does not clearly evince fo much as the prefence of the
faline principle in it. But I will not (purfues Carneades) remind you, that the volatile
fait of hartfhorn, amber, blood fcfV. are exceeding ftrongly fcenttd, notwithftanding
that moft chymifts deduce odours from fulphur, and from them srrgue the predominancy
of that principle in the odorous body ; becaufe I muft not fo much as add any
new examples of the incompetency of this fort of chymical arguments ; lince having
already detained you but too long in thofe generals, that appertain to my fourth confideration,
it is time, that I proceed to the particulars themfelves, to which I
thought fit they fhould be previous.
These generals (continues Carneades) being thus premifed, we might the better"
furvey the unlikencfs, that an attentive and unprepoffcued obferver may take- notice
of in each fort of bodies, which the chymifts are wont to call the falts of fulphurs or'
mercuries of the concretes that yield them, as if they had all a fimplicity, and identity
of nature : whereas falts, if they were all elementary, would as little differ as do
the drops of pure and fimple water. It b known, that both chymifts and phyficiansafcribe
to the fixt falts of calcined bodies the virtues of their concretes; and confe--
quently very differing operations. So we find the alkali of wormwood much commended
in diftempers of the ftomach ; that of eye-bright for thofe that have a weak
fight ; and that of guaiacum (of which a great' quantity yields but a very little fait)
is not only much commended in venereal difeafes, but is believed to have a peculiar
Furgativc virtue, which yet I have not had occafion to try. And though, I confefs,
have long thought, that thefe alkalizate falts are, for the moft part, very near of
kin, and retain very little of the properties of the concretes whence they were fepanued

exceptions to this general obervation, I obferved at the glafs-houfe, that fomctimet
the metal (as the workmen call it) or mafs of colliquated ingredients, which by
blowing they fafhion into veffels of divers fhapes, did fometimes prove of a very
differing colour, and a fomewhat differing texture, from what was ufual. And
having inquired, whether the caufe of fuch accidents might not be derived from the
peculiar nature of the fixe fait employed to bring the fand to fufion, I found, that the
knowingeft workmen imputed thefc mif-adventures to the afhes of fome certain kind
of wood, as having obferved the ignobler kind of glafs I lately mentioned to be
frequently produced, when they had employed fuch forts of afhes, which therefore
they fcruple to make ufc of, if they took notice of them beforehand. I remember
alfo, that an induftrious man of my acquaintance having bought a vaft quantity of
tobacco-flalks to make a fixt fait with, I had the curiofity to go fee, whether that
exotick plant, which fo much abounds in volatile fait, would afford a peculiar kind
of alkali and I was pleafed to find, that in the lixivium of it it was not necefiary,
as is ufual, to evaporate all the liquor, that there might be obtained a fkline calx,
confifting like lime quenched in the air of a heap of little corpufcles of unregarded
fhapes ; but the fixt fait {hot into figured cryflal, almolt as nitre or fal armoniac and
other uncalcined falts are wont to do. And 1 further remember, that I have obferved,
in the fixt fait of urine, brought by depuration to be very white, a tafte not fo unlike
to that of common fait, and very differing from the wonted cauftick lixiviate
tafte of the other falts made by incineration. But becaufe the inftances I have alledged
of the difference of alkalizate fait are but few, and therefore I am Hill inclined to
think, that moft chymifts and many phyficians do, inconfiderately enough, and without
warrant from experience, afcribe the virtues of the concretes, expofed to calcination,
to the falts obtained by it ; I (hall rather, to fhew the dilparity of fa Ira,
mention in the firfl place the apparent difference betwixt the vegetable fixt falts and
the animal volatile ones : as (for example) betwixt fait of tartar, and fait of hartfhorn
whereof the former is fo fixt, that it will indure the brunt of a violent fire,
and (land in fufion like a metal , whereas the other (befides, that it has a differing
tafte and a very differing fmell) is fo far far from being fixt, that it will fly away in a
gentle heat as eafily as fpirit of wine itfelf. And to this I (hall add, in the next
place, that even among the volatile falts themfelvcs, there is a confidcrable difference,
as appears by the diltinct properties of (for inftance) fait of amber, fait of urine, fait
of man's fkull, (fo much extolled againft the falling ficknefs) and divers others,
which cannot efcape an ordinary obferver. And this diverfity of volatile falts I have
obferved to be fometimes difcernable even to the eye, in their figures. For the fait
of hartfhorn I have obferved to adhere to the receiver, in the form almoft of a pa»
rallelopipedon and of the volatile fait of human blood (long digefted before diftillation,
with fpirit of wine) I can fhew you (lore of grains of that figure, which
geometricians call a rhombus ; though I dare not undertake, that the figures of
thefc or other faline cryftals (if I may fo call them) will be always the fame, whatever
degree of fire have been employed to force them up, or how hafiily foever they
been made to convene in the fpirits or liquors, in the lower part of which, 1 have
ufually obferved them, after a while to fhoot. And although, as I lately told you,
I feldom found any difference, as to medical virtues, in the fixt falts of divers vegetables
•, and accordingly I have fufpetted that moft of thefe volatile falts, having fo
great a refemblance in fmell, in talte, and fugitivenefs, differ but little, if at all, in
their medicinal properties : as indeed I have found them generally to agree in divers

them (as in their being fomewhat diaphoretick and very deopilativc) yet I remember
• Helmont fomcwhere informs us, that there is this difference betwixt the faline
fpirit of urine and that of man's blood, that the former will not cure the cpilepfy,
but the latter will. Of the efficacy alfo of the fait of common amber againit the
fame difcafe in children, (for in grown perfons it is not a fpccifkk) I may elfewhcre
have an occaflon to entertain you. And when I confider, that to the obtaining of
thefc volatile lalts (efpecially that of urine)there is not rcquifite fuch a deftruftive
violence of the fire, as there is to get thofc falts that muft be made by incineration, I
am the more invited to conclude, that they may differ from one another, and confcquently
recede from an elementary fimplicity. And if I could here lhcw you, what
Mr. Boyle has obferved, touching the various chymical dirt irittions of falts j you
would quickly difcern, not only that chymifts do give themfelves a ftrangc liberty to
call concretes falts, that are, according to their own rules, to be looked upon as
very compounded bodies ; but that among thofe very falts, that feem elementary,
becaufc produced upon the anatomy of the bodies, that yield them, there is not only
a vifible difparity, but, to fpeak in the common language, a manifeft antipathy or
contrariety : as is evident in the ebullition and hiding, that is wont to enfue, whcA
the acid fpirit of vitriol, for inftance, is poured upon pot- allies, or fak of tartar.
And I mall beg leave of this gentleman, (fays Carneades) calling his eyes on me, to
let me obferve to you, out of fome of his papers, particularly thofe, wherein he treats
of feme preparations of urine, that not only one and the lame body may have two
falts of a contrary nature, as he exemplifies in the fpirit and alcali of nitre •, but that
from the fame body there may, without addition, be obtained three differing and
vifible falts. For he relates, that he obferved in urine, not only a volatile and
cryftalline fait, and a fixt fait, but likewife a kind of fal armoniac, or fuch a fait as
would fublime in the form of a fait, and therefore was not fixt, and yet was far from
being fo fugitive as the volatile fait j from which it feemed alfo otherwife to differ.
1 have indeed fufpe&ed, that this may be a fal armoniac properly enough fo called,
as compounded of the volatile fait of urine, and the fixt of the fame liquor, which,
as I noted, is not unlike fea-falt ; but that itfelf argues a manifeft difference betwixt
the falts, fince fuch a volatile fait is not wont to unite thus with an ordinary alkali,
but to fly away from it in the heat. And on this occafion I remember, that to give
fome of my friends an ocular proof of the difference betwixt the fixt and volatile
fait of (the fame concrete) wood, I devifed the following experiment : I took common
Venetian fublimate, and diffolved as much of it as I well could in fair water ; then
I took wood-alhes, and pouring on them warm water, diffolved their fait ; and
filtrating the water, as foon as I found the lixivium fufikiently fharp. upon the
tongue, I referved it for ufe. Then on one part of the former folution of fublimate
dropping a little of this diffolved fixt fait of wood, the liquors prefcntly turned
of an orange colour ; but upon the other part of the clear folution or fublimate putting
fome of the volatile la!t of wood (which abounds in the fpirit of foot) the
liquor immediately turned white, almoft like milk, and after a while let fall a white
fediment, as the other liquor did a yellow one. To all this that I have faid
concerning the difference of falts, I might add what I formerly told you, concerning
the limple lpirit of box, and fuch like woods, which differ much from the other

falts hitherto mentioned, and yet would belong to the faline principle, if chymifts
did truly teach, that all talles proceed from it. And I might alfo annex, what I
noted to you out of • Htlmont concerning bodies, which, though they confift in
great part of chymical oils, do yet appear but volatile falts : but to infill on thefe
things, were to repeat \ and therefore I fhall proceed.
This difparity is alfo highly eminent in the feparated fulphurs or chymicil oils of
things. For they contain fo much of the fcent, and talle, and vertucs, of the boJics,
whence they were drawn, that they feem to be but the material crafis (if I may fo
ipcak) of their concretes. Thus the oils of cinnamon, cloves, nutmegs and other
(pices, feem to be but the united aromatic parts, that did enoble thofe bodies. And
it is a known thing, that oil of cinnamon, and oil of cloves, (which I have likewife
obferved in the oils of fcvcral woods) will fink to the bottom of water \ whereas
thofe of nutmegs and divers other vegetables will fwim upon it. The oil (abufively
called fpirit) of rofes fwims at the top of the water in the form of a white butter,
which I remember not to have .obferved in any other oil drawn in any limbeck yet
there is a way (not here to be declared) by which I have feen it come over in the form
of other aromatic oils, to the delight and wonder of thofe that beheld it. In oil of
anifceds, which I drew both with, and without fermentation, I obferved the whole
body of the oil in a cool place to thicken into the confidence and appearance of white
>buttcr, which, With the lead heat, refumed its former liquidnefs. In the oil of olive
drawn over in a retort, I have likewife more than once feen a fpontaneous coagulation
in the receiver : and I have of it by me thus congealed i which is of fuch a ftrangely
penetrating fcenr, as if it would perforate the nofes that approach it. The Tike
pungent odour I alfo obferved in the diftillcd liquor of common foap, which forced
.over from minium, lately afforded an oil of a moft admirable penetrancy : and he
muft be a great ftranger, both to the writings and preparations of chymifts, that fees
not in the oils they diftill from vegetables and animals, a confiderable and obvious
difference. Nay, I fhall venture to add, EUutberiiu, (what perhaps you will think
of kin to a paradox, that divers times out of the fame animal or vegetable, there may
be extra&ed oils of natures obvioufly differing. To which purpofe I fhall not infill
on the fwimming and finking oils, which I have fometimes obferved to float on, and
iubfidc under the fpirit of guaiacum, and that of divers other vegetables diflilled
with a ftrong and lading fire ; nor fhall I infill on the obfervation elfewhere mentioned,
.of the divers and unmingleable oils afforded us by human blood, long fermented and
.digeded with fpirit of wine •, becaufe thefe kinds of oils may feem chiefly to differ in
confidence and weight, being all of them high coloured and adud. But the experiment,
which I deviled to make out this difference of the oils of the fame vegetable,
ad oculum, (as they fpeak) was this that follows : I took a pound of anifeeds, and
having grofly beaten them, caufed them to be put into a very large glals retort almod
filled with fair water ; and placing this retort in a fand-furnacc, I caufed a very
gentle heat to be adminidereJ during the fird day, and a great part of the fecond, till
the water was for the mod part drawn off, and had brought over with it at lead
mod of the volatile and aromatic oil of the feeds. And then incrcafing the fire,
.and changing the receiver, I obtained befides an empyreumatica] fpirit, and a quantity

and not eafily fcparable from it. And whereas thefe oils were very dark, and fmclled
(as the chymifts fpeak) fo ftrongly of the fire, that their odour did not betray from
what vegetables they had been forced ; the other aromatic oil was enriched with the
genuine fmell and tafte of the concrete ; and fpontaneoufly coagulating itfclf into
white butter, did manifeft irfclf to be the true oil of anifecds : which concrete I
therefore chofc to employ about this experiment, that the difference of thefc oils
might be more confpicuous than it would have been, had I, inftead of it, diftilled
another vegetable.
I had almoft forgot to take notice, that there is another fort of bodies, which
though not obtained from concretes by diftillation, many chymifts are wont to call
their fulphur; not only becaufe fuch fubftances arc, for the moft part, high coloured
(whence they are alfo, and that more properly, called tinctures) as diffolvcd fulphurs
are wont to be ; but efpecially becaufe they are, for the moft part, abftracted and
feparated from the reft of the mafs by fpirit of wine : which liquor thofe men fuppofing
to be fulphureous, they conclude, that what it works upon, and abftracts,
muft be a fulphur alfo. And upon this account they prefume, that they can fequefter
the fulphur even of minerals and metals ; for which it is known, that they cannot by
fire alone feparate it. To all this I mall anfwer, that if thefe fcqueftcred fubftances
were indeed the fulphurs of the bodies, whence they are drawn, there would as well
be a great difparity betwixt chymical fulphurs obtained by fpirit of wine, as I have
already fliewn there is betwixt thofe obtained by diftillation in the form of oils : which
will be evident from hence, that not to urge, that themfelves afcribe diftinft virtues
to mineral tincture of gold againft fuch and fuch difeafes ; the tincture of antimony,
or of its glafs, againft others ; and the tincture of emerald againft others ; it is plain,
that in tinctures drawn from vegetables, if the fupcrfluous fpirit of wine be diftilled
off, it leaves at the bottom that thicker fubftance, which chymifts ufe to call the extract
of the vegetable. And that thefe extracts are endowed with very different qualities,
according to the nature of the particular bodies, that afforded them (though
I fear feldom with fo much of the fpecific virtues, as is wont to be imagined) is freely
confeffed both by phyficians and chymifts. But, Eleutberius (fays Carneades) we may
here take notice, that the chymifts do as well in this cafe, as in many others, allow
themfelves a licence to abufe words : for not again to argue from the differing properties
of tinctures, that they are not exactly pure and elementary fulphurs ; they
would eafily appear not to be fo much as fulphurs, although we fhould allow chymi^
cal oils to dclcrve that name. For however in fome mineral tinctures, the natural
fixednefs of the extracted body docs not always fuffcr it to be eafily further refoluble
into differing fubftances j yet in very many extracts drawn from vegetables, it may
very eafily be manifeftcd, that the fpirit of wine has not fcqueftered the fulphureous
ingredient from the fiiline and mcrcurcal ones, but has diffolvcd (for I take it to be a
folucion) the finer parts of the concrete (without making any nice difiinction of their
being perfectly fulphureous or not) and united itfelf with them into a kind of m.tgiftcry,
which confequcntly muft contain ingredients or parts of feveral forts. For
we fee, that the ftones, that are rich in vitriol, being often drenched with rain-water,
the liquor will then extract a fine and tranfparent fubftance coagulable into vitriol;
and yet though this vitriol be readily di (Voluble in water, it is not a true elementary
fait, but, as you know, a body refoluble into very differing parts, whereof one (as

an elementary nature. You may confidcr alio, that common fulphur is readily dif-

not as much, in fait as in true fulphur -, witnefs the great quantity of faline liquor it
affords, being fct to flame away under a glafs bell. Nay, I have, which perhaps you
will think ftrangf, with the lame oil of turpentine alone cafily enough diflblved crude
antimony finely powdered into a blood red balfam, wherewith perhaps considerable
things may be performed in furgcry. And if it were now rcquilite, I could tell you
of fomc other bodies (fuch as perhaps you would not fufpect) that I have been able
to work upon with certain chymical oils. But inftcad or digrefling further, I (hallnuke
this ufc of the example I have named. That it is not unlikely, but that fpirit
of wine, which by its pungent tafte, and by fomc other qualities, that argue it better
(efpccially its rcduciblends, according to Heimcnt, into altali, and water) items to
be as well of a ialine as of a fulphureous nature, may v/ell be luppofed capable of
diflblving fubftances, that are not merely elementary fulphurs, though perhaps they
may abound with parts, that are of kin thereunto. For I find, that fpirit of wine
will diflblve gum lacca, benzoin, and the refinous parts of jallap, and even of guaiacum
; whence we may well fufpect, that it may from fpices, herbs, and other left
compacted vegetables, extract fubftances, that arc not perfect fulphurs, but mixt
bodies. And to put it paft difputc, there is many a vulgar extract drawn with fpirit
of wine, which committed to diftillation will afford fuch differing fubftances, as will
loudly proclaim it to have been a very compounded body. So that we mayjuftly
fufpect, that even in mineral tinctures it will not always follow, that becaufe a red
fubftance is drawn from the concrete by fpirit of wine, that fubftance is its true and
elementary fulphur. And though fomc of thefe extracts may perhaps be inflammable
j yet, befides that others are not, and befides that their being reduced to fuch
minutenefs of pans may much facilitate their taking fire ; befides this, I fay, we fee,
that common fulphur, common oil, gum lac, and many unctuous and refinous bodies,
will flame well enough, though they be of very compounded natures: nay,,
travellers of unfufpected credit aflure us, as a known thing, that in fome northern
countries, where fir-trees and pines abound, the poorer fort of inhabitants ufe long ,

other menftruums may acquire a red or fome other high colour. But to return to our
chymical oils, fuppofing that they were exactly pure ; yet I hope they would be, as.

of fire, as. an Ariftotelian would conclude, is certainly fomething of a very differing,
nature from a chymical oil, fince it burns, and fhines, and mounts fwiftly upwards
none of which a chymical oil does, whilft it continues fuch. And if it fhould be
objected, that the diflipated parts of this flaming oil may be caught and collected
again into oil or fulphur ; I ihall demand, what chymift appears to have ever done
it : and without examining, whether it may not hence be as well faid, that fulphur is.

whether it may not hence be argued, that neitlier fire nor fulphur arc primitive and
indeftrufrible bodies. And I (hall further obferve, that at leaft it will hence appear,
that a portion of matter may, without being compounded with new ingredients, by
having the texture and motion of its fmall parts changed, be cafily, by the means of
the fire, endowed with new qualities, more differing from them it had before, than
are thofe, which fuffice todifcriminate the chymifts principles from one another.
We are next to confider, whether in the anatomy of mixt bodies, that, which
chymifts call the mercurial part of them, be uncompounded, or no. But to tell you
true, though, chymifts do unanimoufly affirm, that their resolutions difcover a principle,
which they call mercury, yet I find them to give of it defcriptions fo differing,
and fo enigmatical, that I, who am not aftiamed to confefs, that I cannot underftand
what is not fenfe, muft acknowledge to you, that I know not what to make of them.
Paracelfus himfelf, and therefore, as you will eafily believe, many of his followers,
does fomewhere call that mercury, which afcends upon the burning of wood, as the
Peripatetics are wont to take the fame fmoke for air \ and lb feems to define mercury
by volatility, or (if I may coin fuch a word) effumability. But fince, in this example,
both volatile fait and fulphur make part of the fmoke, which does indeed
confift alfo both of phlegmatic and terrene corpufcles, this notion is not to be admitted
•, and I find, that the more fobcr chymifts themfelves difavow it, Yet to fhew
you, how little of clearnefs we are to expedt in the accounts even of later Spagyrifts,
be pleafed to take notice, that Beguinus, even in his Tyrocinium Cbymicum, written for
the inftruction of novices, when he comes to tell us what arc meant by the tria prima,
which for their being principles ought to be defined the more accurately and plainly,
gives us this defcription of mercury Mtrcurius (fays he) eft liquor iUe acidus, permeabiUs, a,*. r>-

neftutifque pr*proper* retardatio. Which words are not fo much a definition of it, as an
encomium : and yet ^utrcetanus, in his defcription of the fame principle, adds to
thefe divers other epithets. But both of them, to fkip very many other faults, that
may be found with-, their metaphorical defcriptions, fpeak incongruoufly to the
chymifts own principles. For if mercury be an acid liquor, either hcrmetical philofophy
muft err in afcribing all taftcs to fait, or elfe mercury muft not be a principle,
but compounded of a faline ingredient and fomewhat elfe. Libavius, though he rinds
great fault with the obfeurity of what the chymifts write concerning their mercurial
principle, docs yet but give us fuch a negative defcription of it, as Sennertus, how
favourable foever to the tria prima, is not latisfied with. And this Sennertus himfelf,
though the learnedeft champion for the hypeftatical principles, does almoft as frequently,
asjuftly, complain of the unfatisfadorinefs of what the chymifts teach concerning
their mercury; and yet he himfelf (but widi his wonted medefty) fubftitutcs
inllead of the defcription of Libavius, another, which many readers, efpecially if
they be not Peripatetics, will not know what to make of. For fcarce telling us any
more, than that in all bodies, that, which is found befides fait and fulphur, and the

the fait and fulphur of the fame concrete, that may not be called the mercury of at
body, which though it afcend in diftillation, as do the phlegm and fulphur, is neither
infipid like the former, nor inflammable like the latter. And therefore I would fubftitute
to the too much abufed name of mercury, the more clear and familiar appellation
of fpirit, which is alfo now very much made ufe of, even by the chymifts
themfclves of our times, though they have not given us fo diftinct an explication, as
were fit, of what may be called the fpirit of a mixt body.
I should not perhaps (fays Corneades) much quarrel with your notion of mercury.
But as for the chymifts, what they can mean, with congruity to their own principles,
by the mercury of animals and vegetables, it will not be fo cafy to rind out ; for they
afcribe taftes only to the faline principle, and confequently would be much put to ic
to flic w what liquor it is, in the resolution of bodies, that not being infipid, for that
they call phlegm, neither is inflammable as oil or fulphur, nor has any tafte •, which,
according to them, muft proceed from a mixture, at leaft, of fait. And if we
fhould take fpirit in the fenfc of the word received among modern chymifts and phyfkians,
for any d: (til led liquor, that is neither phlegm nor oil, the appellation would
yet appear ambiguous enough. For plainly, that which firft afccnds in the diftillation
or wine and fermented liquors, is generally as well by chymifts as others reputed
a fpirit. And yet pure fpirit of wine being wholly inflammable, ought, according
to them, to be reckoned to the fulphureous, not the mercureal principle. Ana
among the other liquors, that go under the name of fpirits, there are divers, which
feem to belong to the family ot falts \ fuch as arc the fpirit of nitre, vitriol, fea-falt
and others, and even the fpirit of hartfhorn, being as I have tried, in great part, if
not totally, reducible into fait and phlegm, may be fufpcctcd to be but a volatile fait,
difguifed by the phlegm mingled with it into the form of a liquor ; however, if this
be a fpirit, it manifestly differs very much from that of vinegar, the tafte of the one
being acid, and the other fait ; and their mixture, in cafe they be very pure, fometimcs
occafioning an effcrvefcence like that of thofe liquors the chymifts account molt
contrary to one another. And even among thofe liquors, that feem to have a better'
title, than thofe hitherto mentioned, to the name of fpirits, there appears a fcnfible
diverfity •, for fpirit of oak, for inftance, differs from that of tartar, and this fronv
that of box, or of guaiacum. And in fhort, even thefe fpirits, as well as other diftilled
liquors, manireft a great difparity betwixt themfclves, either in their actions on*
our fenfes, or in their other operations.
And (continues Carnta&ts) befides this difparity, that is to be met with among
thofe liquors, that the moderns call fpirits, and take for fimilar bodies, what I have
formerly told you concerning the fpirit of box-wood, may let you fee, that fome of
thofe liquors not only have qualities very differing from others, but may be further
rcfolved into fubftanccs differing from one another.
And fince many modem chymifts and other naturalifts are pleafed to take the mercurial
fpirit of bodies for the fame principle, under differing names, I muft invite yoiv
to obferve, with me, the great difference, that is confpicuous betwixt all the vegetable
and animal fpirits I have mentioned, and running mercury. I fpeak not of t!iatT
which is commonly fold in fhops, that many of themfclves will confefs to be a mixt
body •, but of that, which is fepamed from metal";, which by fome chymifts, that
feem more philofophers tfun the reft, and elpet'ully by the above mentioned Ciaveus,
is (for diftinction take] called mercurius cerpcrttm. Now this metalline liquor being
one of thofe three principles, of which mineral bodies are, by Spagyrilts, affirmed to

d&em and the mercuries, as they call them, of vegetables and animals, will allow me
to infer, either that minerals and the other two forts of mixt bodies con Hit not of the
feme elements, or that thole principles, whereunto minerals are immediately rcfolved,
which chymifts with great oftentation (hew us as the true principles of them, arc but
fecondary principles, or mixts of a peculiar fort, which muft be themfclves reduced
to a very differing form, to be of the fame kind with vegetable and animal
liquors.
But this is not all ; for though I formerly told you, how litde credit there is to be
given to the chymical proceffes, commonly to be met with, of extracting the mercuries
of metals, yet 1 will now add, that fuppofing, that the more judicious of
them do not untruly affirm, that they have really drawn true and running mercury
from fcveral metals (which I wifh they had clearly taught us how to do alfo) yet it
may be Hill doubted, whether fuch extracted mercuries do not as well differ from
common quickGlver, and from one another, as from the mercuries of vegetables and
animals. Claveus *, in his apology, lpeaking offome experiments, whereby metalline
mercuries may be fixt into the nobler metals, adds, that he fpake of the mercuries
drawn from metals •, became common quickfilver, by reafon of its exceflive coldnefs
and moifture, is unfit for that particular kind of operation ; for which, though a few
lines before he prefcribes in general the mercuries of metalline bodies, yet he chiefly
commends that drawn by art from filver. And elfewhere, in the lame book, he tcllr
us, that he himlelf tried, that by bare coftion the quickfilver of tin or pewter (arpnlum
vivum ex fianno prolicitum) may, by an efficient caufc (as he fpeaks) be turned
into pure gold. And the experienced Alexander van Sucbten fomewherc tells us,
that by a way he intimates may be made a mercury of copper, not of the filver colour
of other mercuries, but green \ to which 1 lhall add, that an eminent perfon,,
whofe name his travels and learned writings have made famous, lately a i lured me,
that he had more than once feen the mercury of lead (which whatever authors promife,
you will find it very difficult to make, at lcaft in any confiderable quantity) fixt
into perfect gold. And being by me demanded, whether or no any other mercury
would not as well have been changed by die fame operations, he allured me of the
negative.
And fince I am fallen upon the mention of the mercuries of metals, you will,
perhaps, expeel (Eleutberius) that 1 fhould fay fomething of their two other principles
; but I muft freely confefs to you, that what difjurity there may be between the
falts and fulphurs of metals or other minerals, I am noc myfeif experienced enough
in the reparations and examens of them, to venture to determine : (for, as for the falts
of metals, I formerly reprefented it as a thing much to be quefUoncd, whether they
have any at all.) And for the procefies of leparation I find in authors, if they were
(what many of them are not) fucccfsfully practicable, as I noted above, yet they are
to be performed by the affiftance of other bodies, fo hardly, if upon any terms at
all, liparable from them, that it is very difficult to give the (eparattd principles all
their due, and no more. But the fulphur of antimony, which is vehemently vomitive,
and the ftrongly fecnted anodyne fulphur of vitriol, inclines me to think, diat
not only mineral fulphurs differ from vegetable ones, but alfo from one another, retaining
much of the nature of their concretes. The falts of metals, and of fome fort
of minerals, you will eafily guefs (by the doubts 1 formerly cxprefied, whether mc-

<he four elements, i (hall content myfelf to infer from the alleged pafiage, that if hi*
doftrine be not confillent with that part of mine, which it is brought to countenance,
it is very difficult to know what his opinion concerning fait, fulphur, and mercury*
•was ; and that confequently we had reafon, about the beginning of our conferences,
to decline taking upon us, cither to examine or oppofe it.
I know not whether I mould on this occalion add, that thofe very bodies, the
.chymifts call phlegm and earth, do yet recede from an elementary fimplicity. That
common earth and water frequently do fo, notwithftanding the received contrary
opinion, is not denied by the more wary of the modern Peripatetics thcmfelves : and
-certainly moft earths are much lefs fimple bodies than is commonly imagined even by
chymifts, who do not fo confiderately, to prefcribe and employ earths promifcuoufly
in thofe diftillations, that require the mixture of fome caput mortuum, to hinder the
flowing together of the matter, and to retain its grofler parts. For I have found
fome earths to yield, by diftillation, a liquor very far from being inodorous or infipid •,
and it is a known obtervation, that moft kinds of fat earth kept covered from the
rain, and hindered from fpending themfelves in the production of vegetables, will in
time become impregnated with falt-pctre.
But I muft remember, that the water and earths I ought here to fpeak of, are fuch
«s are feparated from mixt bodies by the fire j and therefore to rcftrain my difcourfe
to fuch, I fhall tell you, that we fee the phlegm of vitriol (for inftance) is a very
effectual remedy againft burns ; and I know a very famous and experienced phyfician,
whole unfufpetted fecret {himfelf confelled to me) it is, for the difcuffing of hard
and obllinatc tumours. The phlegm of vinegar, though drawn exceeding leifurely
in a digefting furnace, I have purpofely made trial of; and fomctimes found it able
to draw, though flowly, a faccarine fwectnefs out of lead •, and as I remember, by
Jong digeftion, I difiolved corals in it. The phlegm of the fugar of Saturn is faid

pearls, which being precipitated by the fpirit of the fame concrete, are thereby (as
they lay) rendered volatile \ which has been confirmed to me, upon his own obfervation,
by a perlon of great veracity. The phlegm of wine, and indeed divers
other liquors, that are indifcriminately condemned to be call away as phlegm, are
endowed with qualities, that make them differ both from mecr water, and from each
other. And whereas the chymifts are pleafed to call the caput mortuum of what they
have diddled (after they have, by affufion of water, drawn away its fait) terra damftata,
or earth, it may be doubted, whether or no thofe earths are all of them perfectly
alike; and it is fcarcc to be doubted, but that there are fome of them, which
remain yet unreduced to an elementary nature. The afhes of wood, deprived of all
the fait, and bonc-afhes, or calcined hartfhorn, which refiners choofe to make jefta
of, as frecft from fait, feem unlike : and he that fhall compare either of thefe infipid
afhes to lime, and much more to the calx of talc (though by the affufion of water
they be exquifitdy dulcified) will perhaps fee caufe to think them things of a fomcwhat
different nature. And it is evident in colcothar, that the exadeft calcination,
followed by an exquifite dulcification, does not always reduce the remaining body
into elementary earth •, for after the fait or vitriol (if the calcination have been too
faint) is drawn out of the colcothar, the refidue is not earth, but a mixt body, rich
in medical virtues (as experience has informed me) and which Angelus Sola affirms tobe
partly reducible into malleable copper : which I judge very probable ; for though,-
when I was making experiments upon colcothar, I was deftitute of a furnace capable
of giving a heat intcufe enough to bring fuch a calx to fufion yet having conjectured,
that if colcothar abounded with that metal, aqua fords would find it out
there,. I put fome dulcified cokothar into that menftruum, and found the liquor, according
to my expectation, prefently coloured as highly, as if it had been an ordinary
folution of copper.

54-4- 7U Sceptical Chvmist,
If you remember (replies Carneades) that at the beginning of our conference with
Pbiloponvi, I declared to him before the reft of the company, that I would not enchymifts,
for the vulgar doctrine of their three hypoftatical principles} you will
eafily perceive, that I am not obliged to make anfwer to what you newly propofed i
and that it rather grants, than difproves what I have been contending for : fince by
pretending to make fo great a change in the reputed principles, that diftillation affords
the common Spagyrifts, it is plainly enough pre-fuppofed, that before fuch artificial
depurations be made, the fubftances to be made more fimple were not yet fimple
enough to be looked upon as elementary : wherefore in cafe the artifts you fpeak of
could perform what they give out they can, yet I fhould not need to be alhamed of
having queftioned the vulgar opinion touching the tria prima. And as to the thing
itfelf, I (hall freely acknowledge to you, that I love not to be forward in determining
things to be impoflible, till I know and have confidered the means, by which
they are propofed to be effected. And therefore I fhall not peremptorily deny, either
the poflibility of what thefe artifts promifc, or my aflent to any juft inference, however
deftructive to my conjectures, that may be drawn from their performances. But
give me leave to tell you withal, that becaufc fuch promifes are wont (as experience
has more than once informed me) to be much more eafily made, than made good
by chymifts, I mult with-hold my belief from their affertions, till their experiments
exact it \ and muft not be fo eafy as to expect before-hand an unlikely thing, upon
ftronger inducements than are yet given me : befides that I have not yet found by
what I have heard of thefe artifts, that though they pretend to bring the feveral fubftances,
into which the fire has divided the concrete, to an exquifite firoplicity* they
pretend alfo to be able by the fire to divide all concretes, minerals, and others, into
the fame number of diftinct fubftances. And in the mean time I muft think it improbable,
that they can either truly feparate as many differing bodies from gold (for
inftance) or oftiocolla, as wc can do from wine, or vitriol •, or that the mercury (for
example) of gold or Saturn would be perfectly of the fame nature with that of hartihorn
; and that the fulphur of antimony would be but numerically different from the
diftillcd butter or oil of rofes.
But fuppofc (fays Eleutber'tus) that you mould meet with chymifts, who would allow
you to take in earth and water into the number of the principles of mixt bodies ; and
being alfo content to change the ambiguous name of mercury for that more intelligible
one of fpirit, mould confequently make the principles or compound bodies to
be five , would you not think it fometning hard to reject fo plaufible an opinion, only
becaufe the five fubftances, into which the fire divides mixt bodies, are not exactly
pure, and homogeneous ? For my part (continues Eltutbtrlus) I cannot but think
it fomewhat ftrange, in cafe this opinion be not true, that it fhould fall out fo
luckily, that fo great a variety of bodies fhould be analyzed by the fire into juft five
diftinct fubftances •, which fo little differing from the bodies, that bear thofe names,
may fo plaufibly be called oil, fpirit, fait, water, and earth.
The opinion you now propofe (anfwers Carntades) being another than that I was
engaged to examine, it is not rcquifite for me to debate at this prcfcnt j nor fhould I
have leifure to do it throughly. Wherefore, I fhall only tell you in general, that
though I think this opinion in fomc refpects more defcnfible than that of the vulgar
chymifts ; yet you -may eafily enough learn from the paft difcourfe, what may be
thought of it : fince many of the objections made againit the vulgar doctrine of the
chymifts feem, without much alteration, employable againft this hypothefis alfo. For,

beGdes that this doctrine does, as well as the other, take it for granted (what is not
eafy to be proved) that the fire is the true and adequate analyzer of bodies, and that
all thediftimft lubllances obtainable from a mutt body by the fire, were fb pre-cxiftent
in it, that they were but extricated from each odier by the analyfis •, betides that this
opinion too afcribes to the productions of the fire an elementary fimplitity, which I
have fhewn not to belong to them ; and betides that this doftrinc is liable to foine of
the other difficulties, wherewith that of the tria prima is incumbered : betides all
this, I fay, this quinary number of elements (if you pardon the cxprcftion ) ought at
kaft to have been reftrained to the generality of animal and vegetable bodies, fincc
not only among thefc there are fbme bodies (as I formerly argued) Which, for aught
yet has been made to appear, do contift, either of fewer or more timilar lubllances,
than precifely five. But in the mineral kingdom, there is fcarce one concrete, that
has been evinced to be adequately divitible into fuch five principles or elements,
and neither more nor lefs, as this opinion would have every mixt body to confift
of.
And this very thing (continues Carneades) may fcrve to take away or lefien your
wonder, that juft fo many bodies as five mould be found upon the refolution of concretes.
For fince we find not, that the fire can make any fuch analyfis (into five
elements) of metals and other mineral bodies, whofc texture is more ftrong and permanent,
it remains, that the five fubftances under confideration be obtained from
vegetable and animal bodies, which (probably by reafon of their loofer contexture)
are capable of being diddled. And as to fuch bodies, it is natural enough, that,
whether we fuppofc, that there are, or are not, precifely five elements, there fhould
ordinarily occur in the diffipated parts, a five-fold diverfity of fcheme (if I may fo
fpcak.) For, if the parts do not remain all fixed, as in gold, calcined talc, ZSc. nor
all afcend, as in the fublimation of brimftone, camphire, fcfr. but after their diflipation
do afibciate themfelves into new fchemcs of matter \ it is very likely, that they
wilL by the fire, be divided into fixed and volatile ; (I mean, in reference to that
degree of heat, by which they are diflilled) and thofe volatile parts will, for the
molt part, afcend cither in a dry form, which chymifts are pleafed to call, if they be
taftelefs, flowers ; if fapid, volatile fait t or in a liquid form. And this liquor muft
be either inflammable, and fo pais for oil ; or not inflammable, and yet fubtile and
pungent, which may be called fpirit ; or elfe ftrcngthlefs or infipid, which may be
named phlegm, or water. And as for the fixth part, or caput mortuum, it will moft
commonly contift of corpufcles, partly foluble in water, or fapid (efpecially if the
falinc parts were not fo volatile, as to fly away before) which make up its fixt fait
;
and partly infoluble and inlipid, which therefore feems to challenge the name of
earth. But although upon this ground one might cafily enough have foretold, that
the differing fubftances obtained from a perfectly mixt body by the lire would for the
moft part be reducible to the five newly-mentioned ftates of matter ; yet it will not
patently follow, that thefc five diftinft fubftances were fimple and primogeneal bodies,
fo pre-exiftent in the concrete, that the lire docs but take thein afunder. Betides
that it docs not appear, that all mixt bodies (witnefs, gold, fiber, mercury, &e.)
nay, nor perhaps all vegetables, which may appear by what we laid above of camphire,
benzoin, idc. are rciolubic by fire into juft fuch differing fchemcs of matter.
Nor will the experiments, formerly alleged, permit us to look upon thefc feparated
fubftances as elementary or uncompounded. Neither will it be a fuflkicnt argument
of their being bodies, that deferve the names, which chymifts are pleafed to give
t'lem, that they have an analogy in point of confiftcncc, or cither volatility or fixed-

nefs, or elfe fome other obvious quality, with the fuppofed principles, whofe names
are afcribed to them. For, as I told you above, notwithftanding this reiemblance
in fome one quality, there may be fuch a difparity in others, as may be more fit to
give them differing appellations, than the reiemblance is to give them one and the
fame. And indeed it feems but fomewhat a grofs way of judging of the nature of
bodies, to conclude without fcruplc, that thofe muft be of the fame nature, that
agree in fome fuch general quality, as fluidity, drynefs, volatility, and the like:
fince each of thofe qualities, or ftates of matter, may comprehend a great variety of
bodies, otherwifc of a very differing nature ; as we may fee in the cables of gold, of
vitriol, and of Venetian talc, compared with common aihes •, which yet are very dry,
and fixed by the vehemence of the fire, as well as they. And as we may likewifc
gather from what I have formerly obferved, touching the fpirit of box-wood, whiclt
though a volatile, fapid, and not inflammable liquor, as well as the fpirits of hartfhorn,
of blood and others, (and therefore has been hitherto called the fpirit, and
efteemed for one of the principles of the wood that affords it) may yet, as I told
you, be fubdivided into two liquors, differing from one another, and one of them at
lcaft, from the generality of other chymical fpirits.
Bur you may yourfelf, if you pleafe, (purfues Carneades) accommodate to th*
hypothefis you propofed, what other particulars you fhall think applicable to it in
the foregoing dUcourfc. For I think it unfcafonable for me to meddle now any
further with a controversy, which, fince it does not now belong to me, leaves me at
liberty to take my own time to declare myfclf about it.
Eleutherius perceiving, diat Carneades was fomewhat unwilling to fpend any
more time upon the debate of this opinion, and having perhaps fome thoughts of
taking hence a rife to make him difcourfc it more fully another time, thought not fit
as then to make any further mention to him of the propofed opinion , but told
him,
I presume I need not mind you, Carneades, that both the patrons of the ternary
number of principles, and thofe that would have five elements, endeavour to back
their experiments with a fpecious reafon or two; and cfpecially fome of thofe cmbracers
of the opinion laft named (whom I have converfed with, and found them
learned men) aflign this reafon of the neceflity of five diftinct elements ; that otherwife
mixt bodies could not be fo compounded and tempered, as to obtain a due
confidence and competent duration. For fait (fay the)') is the bafis of folidity, and
permanency in compound bodies, without which the other four elements might
indeed be varioufly and looftly blended together, but would remain incompaded >
but that fait might be difiblved into minute parts, and conveyed to the other fublhnces
to be compacted by it, and with it, there is a neceflity of water. And that
the mixture may not be too hard and brittle, a fulphureous or oily principle muft;
intervene, to make the mafs more tenacious : to this a mercurial ipirit muft: be
furperadded •, which by its activity may for a while permeate, and, as it were, leaven
the whole mafs, and thereby promote the more exquifite mixture and incorporation
of the ingredients. To all which, laftly, a portion of earth muft be added, which
by its diynefs and poroGty may foak up pare of that water, wherein the fait was
diffolvcd, and eminently concur with the other ingredients to give the whole body
the requifite confidence.
I PkRctiVE (fays Carneades fmiling) that if it be true, as it was lately noted from
the proverb, Tbat good uits have bad memories, you have that title, as well as a bettc,
r» to a place among the good For you have already <->r,re than ence fagot,

that I declared to you, that T would at this conference examine only the experiments
of my adversaries, not their fpeculative reafons. Yet it is not (fubjoins Carneades)
for jear of meddling with the argument you have propofed, that I decline the
examining it at prefent. For if when we arc more at leifurc, you fliall have a mind,
that we may lblcmnly confider of it together ; I am confident we fhall fcarcc find it
infoluble. And in the mean time we may obferve, that fuch a way of arguing may,
it feems, be fpecioufly accommodated to differing hypothefes. For 1 find, that
Beguiftus, and other aflertors of the tria prima, pretend to make out by fuch a way
the requifitenefe of their fait, fulphur and mercury, to cenftitute mixt bodies, without
taking notice of any neceflity of an addition of water and earth.
And indeed neither fort of chymifts feem to have duly confidercd, how great
variety there is in the textures and confiftences of compound bodies ; and how little
the confluence and duration of many of them feem to accommodate and be explicable
by the propofed notion. And not to mention thofe almoft incorruptible fubftances
obtainable by the fire, which I have proved to be fomewhat compounded, and
which the chymifts will readily grant not to be perfectly mixt bodies ; (not to mention
thefc, I fay) if you will but recall to mind fome of thofe experiments, whereby I
(hewed you, that out of common water not only mixt bodies (but even living ones) of
very differing confiftences, and refolublc by fire into as many principles as other
bodies acknowledged to be perfectly mixt, may .be produced ; if you do this, I fay,
you will not, I fuppofe, be averfc from believing, <hat nature, by a convenient difpoficion
of the minute parts of a portion of matter, may contrive bodies durable
enough, and of this, or that, or the other confiftence, without being obliged to
make ufe of all, much lefs of any determinate quantity of each of the five elements,
ox of the three principles to compound fuch bodies of. And I have (purfues Carntades)
fomething wondered, chymifts mould not confider, that there is fcarce any
body in nature fo permanent and indiflbluble as glafs ; which yet themfelves teach us
may be made of bare alhes, brought to fuflon by the meer violence of the fire j fo
that, fince alhes are granted to conflft but of pure fait and Ample earth, fequeftered
from all the other principles or elements, they muft acknowledge, that even art rtfelf
can of two elements only, or if you pleafe, one principle and one element, compound
a body more durable than almoft any in the world. Which being undeniable, how
will they prove, that nature cannot compound mixt bodies, and even durable ones,
under all the five elements or material principles ?
But to infift any longer on this occasional difquifition, touching their opinion, that
would eftablifll five elements, were to remember as little as you did before, that the
debate of this matter i% no part of my firft undertaking ; and confequcntly, that I
have already fpent time enough in what I look back upon but as a digreflion, or at
beft an excurfion.
And thus, Eiaabmus, (fays CarneaJes) having at length gone through the four
c on fi derations I propofed to difcourfe unto you, I hold it not unfit, for fear my
having infifted fo long on each of them may have made you forget their feries, briefly
to repeat them by telling you, that
Since, in the firft place, it may juftly be doubted, whether or no the fire be, as
chymifts fuppofe it, the genuine and univerfal refolver of mixt bodies
Since we may doubt, in the next place, whether or no all the diftincr. fubftances,
that may be obtained from a mixt body by the fire, were pre-cxiftent there, in die
forms, in which they were feparated from it j
4 A 2 Since
548 755* Sceptical Chymist.
Since alio, though you fhould grant the fubftances feparable from mixt bodies by
the fire, to have been their component ingredients, yet the number of fuch fubftances
does not appear the fame in all mixt bodies , fome of them being refbluble
into more differing fubftances than three, and others not being refolublc into fo many
as three
And fince, laftly, thofe very fubftances, that are thus feparated, are not, for the
molt part, pure and elementary bodies, but new kinds of mixts
Since, I fay, thefe things are fo, I hope you will allow me to infer, that the vulgar
experiments (I might perchance have added, the arguments too) wont to be
alledged by chymifts to prove, that their three hypoftatical principles do adequately
compofe all mixt bodies, are not fo demonftrativc, as to induce a wary perfon to
acquit- Ice in their doctrine, which, till they explain and prove it better, will, by its
perplexing darknefs, be more apt to puzzle than fatisfy confidcring men, and will
to them appear incumbered with no fmall difficulties.
Anu from what has been hitherto deduced (continues Carneads) we may learn,
what to judge of the common practice of thofe chymifts, who, becaufe they have
found, that divers compound bodies (for it will not hold in all) can be refolved into,
or rather can be brought to afford two or three differing fubftances more than the
foot and afhes, whereunto the naked fire commonly divides them in our chimneys,
cry up their own feci for the invention of a new philofophy ; fome of them, as Htlmonty
13c. ftyling themfelves phitofophers by the fire j and the moft part not only
afcribing, but, as far as in them lies, engrofling to thofe of their feet the title of Philofophers.
But alas, how narrow is this philofophy, that reaches but to fome of thofe compound
bodies, which we find but upon, or in the cruft or outfide of our terreftria!
globe, which is itlelf but a point in companion of the vaft extended univcrfe, of
whofe other and greater parts the doctrine of the tria prima does not give us an account
! For what does it teach us, either of the nature of the fun, which aftronomers
affirm to be eight fcore and odd times bigger than the whole earth ? or of that of
thofe numerous fixt ftars, which, for aught we know, would very few, if any of
them, appear inferior in bulk and brightnefs to the fun, if they were as near us as
he ? What does the knowing that fait, (ulphur and mercury, are the principles of
mixt bodies, inform us of the nature of that vaft, fluid, and aetherial fubftancr,
that feems to make up the interftellar, and confcquently much the greateft part of
the world ? For as for the opinion commonly afcribed to Paracelfus, as if he would
have not only the four Pcripatetick elements, but even the celeftial pans of the univcrfe,
to confift of his three principles, fince the modern chymifts themfelves have
not thought fo groundlcfs a conceit worth their owning, 1 (hall not think it worth my
confuting.
But 1 fhould, perchance, forgive the hypothefis I have been all this while
examining, if, though it reaches but to a very little part of the world, it did at leaft
give us a latbfaftory account of thofe things, to which it is faid to reach. But I find
not, that it gives us any other than a very imperfect information even about mixt
bodies themlclvcs : for how will the knowledge of the tria prima difcover to us the
reafon, why the load-ftone draws a needle, and difpofes it to refpect the poles, and
yet feldom precifcly points at them ? How will this hypothefis teach us, how a chick
is formed in the egg, or how the feminal principles of mint, pompions, and other
vegetables, that I mentioned to you above, can fafhion water into various plants,

fpecifick and difcriminating qualities ? How does this hypothefis (hew us, how much

pompion ? And if we know that, what principle is it, that manages thefc ingredients,

variety of textures, as is requifite to fafhion the bones, veins, arteries, nerves, tendons,
feathers, blood, and other parts of a chick ? and not only to fafhion each
limb, but to connect them all together, after that manner, that is moft congruous
to the perfection of the animal, which is to confift of them ? For to fay, that fome
more fine and fubtile part of either, or all the hypoftatical principles is the director
in all this bufinefs, and the architect of all this elaborate ftrufture, is to give one
occafion to demand again, what proportion and way of mixture of the tria prima
afforded this architectonick fpirit, and what agent made fo fkilful and happy a mixture
? And the anfwer to this queftion, if the chymifts will keep themfelves within
their three principles, will be liable to the fame inconvenience, that the anfwer to
the former was. And if it were not to intrench upon the theme of a friend of ours
here prefent, I could eafily profecute the imperfections of the vulgar chymifts philofophy,
and fhew you, that by going about to explicate by their three principles, I
lay not, ail the abftrufe properties of mixt bodies, but even fuch obvious and more
familiar phenomena as fluidity and firmnefs, the colours and figures of ftoncs, minerals,
and other compound bodies, the nutrition of either plants or animals, the
gravity of gold or quickfilver compared with wine or fpirit of wine •, by attempting,
I fay, to render a reafon of thefe (to omit a thoufand others as difficult to account
for) from any proportion of the three fimplc ingredients, chymifts will be much
more likely to difcredit themfelves and their hypothefis, than fatisfy an intelligent
inquirer after truth.
But (interpofes Elnttberim) this objection feems no more than may be made
againft the four Peripatetick elements j and indeed almoft againft any other hypothefis,
that pretends by any determinate number of material ingredients to render
a reafon of the phenomena of nature. And as for the ufc of the chymical doctrine
ef the three principles, I fuppole you need not be told by me, that the great champion
of it, the learned Senxerlus, afiigns this noble ufe of the tria prima, that from st»». *
them, as the nearcft and moft proper principles, may be deduced and demonftrateJ jj"* *
the properties, which are in mixt bodies, and which cannot be proximately (as they jsj ' p'
fpeak) deduced from the elements. And this, fays he, is chiefly apparent, when we
inquire into the properties and faculties of medicines. And I know (continues Elatiberius)
that the perfon you have aflumed, of an opponent of the hermetick doctrine,
will not fo far prevail againft your native and wonted equity, as to keep you from
acknowledging, that philofophy is much beholden to the notions and difcoverics of
chymifts.
If the chymifts you fpeak of (replies Carnecits) had been fo modeft, or fo difcreer,.
as to propofc their opinion of the tria prima, but as a notion ulcful among others, to
incrcafe human knowledge, they had cldervcd more of our thanks, and Ids of our
opposition: but fince the thinjr, that they pretend, is not fo much to contribute a
notion toward the improvement of philolophy, as to make this notion (attended by
a few lefs confiderable ones) pafs for a new philofophy itfelf ; nay, lince they boult
lb much of this fancy of theirs, that the famous guercetanus fcruples not to write,
that if his moft cemin doctrine of the three principles were fufficiently learned,

affording theorems and axioms irrefragable, and to be admitted without difpuce by
impartial judges, and fo ufcful withal, as to exempt us from the neceflity of having
recourfe, for want of the knowledge of caufes, to that fanduary of the ignorant,
occult qualities : fince I fay, this domeftick notion of the chymifts is fo much overvalued
by them, I cannot think it unfit, they (hould be made l'ciifible of their mifukc
i and be admonilhed to take in more fruitful and comprchenfivc principles, if
they mean to give us an account of the phenomena of nature \ and not confine themfelvcs,
and (as far as they can) others, to fuch narrow principles, as 1 fear will fcarce
enable them to give an account (1 mean an intelligible one) of the tenth part (I fay
not) of all the phsenomena of nature \ but even of all fuch, as by the Leucippian,
or fome of the other forts of principles, may be plaufibly enough explicated. And
though I be not unwilling to grant, that the incompetency I impute to the chymical
hypothefis is but the fame, which may be objected againft that of the four elements,
and divers other doctrines that have been maintained by learned men ; yet fince it
is the chymiral hypothefis only, which I am now examining, I fee not why, if what I
impute to it be a real inconvenience, either it fhould ceatc to be fo, or I (hould
lcruple to object it, becaule other theories are liable thereunto, as well as the hermetical.
For I know not, why a truth (hould be thought lefs a truth for the being fit
to overthrow variety of errors.
I am obliged to you (continues Cameodes, a little fmiling) for the favourable opinion
you are pleafed to cxprefs of my equity, if there be no defign in it. But I need
not be tempted by an artifice, or invited by a compliment, to acknowledge the
great fervice, that the labours of chymifts have done the lovers of ufefuJ learning \
nor even, on this occaiion, (hall their arrogance hinder my gratitude. But fince we
arc as well examining the truth of their dodrine, as the merit of their induftry, I
muft, in order to the inveftigation of the firft, continue a reply, to talk at the rate
of the part I have aflumed •, and tell you, that when I acknowledge the ufefulnefs of
the labours of Spagyrifts to natural philofophy, I do it upon the fcorc of their experiments,
not upon that of their fpcculations i for it fcems to me, that their writings,
as their furnaces, afford as well l'moke as light , and do little lefs obfeure fome fubjeds,
than they illuftrate others. And though I am unwilling to deny, that it is
difficult for a man to be an accomplifhed naturalift, that is a ftranger to chymifhy
yet I look upon the common operations and practices of chymifts, almoft as I do on
the letters of the alphabet, without whofc knowledge it is very hard for a man to
become a philofoplier •, and yet that knowledge is very far from being fufficient to
make him one.
But (fays Carneades, refuming a more ferious look) to confider a little more particularly
what you alledge in favour of the chymical dodrine of the tria prima, though .
I (hall readily acknowledge it not to be unufeful, and that the devifers and cmbracers
of it have done the commonwealth of learning fome iervice, by helping to
dellroy that exceffive efteem, or rather veneration, wherewith the dodrine of the four
elements was almoft as generally, as undefcrvedly entertained ; yet what has been
alledged concerning the ufefulnefs of the tria prima., feems to me liable to no contemptible
difficulties.
And firft, as for the very way of probation, which the more learned and more
fober champions of the chymical caufc employed to evince the chymical principles in
mixt bodies, it fcems to me to be far enough from being convincing. This grand
and leading argument, your Scuntrtus himfclf, who lays great weight upon it, and
tells

The Sceptical Chymist
tells us, that the moll learned philofophers employ this way of reafoning to prove
the moll important things, propofes thus : Ubicunque (fays he) pluribus c*dem ajfeitiones
(sf qualitates infunt, per commune quoddam principium infint necejfe efl, ficut omnia funt
gravia propter terram, calida propter ignem. At colores, adores, fapores, ejfe pAeyir«», £s?
Jimilia alia, mineralibus, metallis, gemmis, lapidtbus, plantis, animalibtts infunt. Ergt
per commune aliquod principium 6? fubjeeJum infunt. At tale principium non funt elementa.
Nulkm enim babent ad tales qualitates producendas potentiam. Ergo alia principia,
unde fluant, inquirenda funt.
In the recital of this argument, (fays Carneades) I therefore thought fit to retain
the language, wherein the author propofes it, that I might alfo retain the propriety
of fome Latin terms, to which I do not readily remember any that fully anfwer in
Englifh. But as for the argumentation itfclf, it is built upon a precarious iuppofuion,
that feems to mc neither demonftrable nor true ; for how does it appear, that where
the fame quality is to be met with in many bodies, it muft belong to them upon
the account of fome one body whereof they all partake ? (for that the major of our
author's argument is to be underftood of the material ingredients of bodies, appears
by the inftances of earth and fire he annexes to explain it.) For to begin with that
very example, which he is pleafed to allcdge for himfelf , how can he prove, that the
gravity of all bodies proceeds from what they participate of the clement of earth,
fince we fc«-, that not only common water, but the more pure diftilled rain-water is
heavy •, and quicldilver is much heavier than earth itfelf, though none of my adverfaries
has yet proved, that it contains any of that element. And I the rather make
ufe of this example of quickfilver, becaufe I fee not how the alienors of the elements
will give any better account of it than the chymifts. For if it be demanded, how
it comes to be fluid, they will anfwer, that it participates much of the nature of
water. And indeed, according to them, water may be the predominant element in
it, fince we fee, that feveral bodies, which by diftillation afford liquors, that weigh
more than their caput mortuum, do not yet confift of liquor enough to be fluid. Yet
if it be demanded, how quickfilver comes to be fo heavy, then it is replied, that
it is by reafon of the earth, that abounds in it; but fince, according to them, it mult
confift alfo of air, and partly of fire, which they affirm to be light elements, how
comes it, that it Ihould be fo much heavier than earth of the fame bulk, though to
fill up the porofities and other cavities it be made up into a mafs or palle with
water, which itfclf they allow to be a heavy element. But to return to our Spagyrifts,
we fee, that chymical oils and fixt falts, though never fo exquifutly purified
and freed from rerreflrial parts, do yet remain ponderous enough. And experience
has informed me, that a pound (for inftancc) of fome of the hcavicft woods, as guaiacum,
that will fink in water, being burnt to afhes will yield a much lefs weight of
them (whereof 1 found but a fmall parr to be alkalizate) than much lighter vegetables:
as alfo that the black charcoal of it will not fink as did the wood, but fwim v
which argues, that the differing gravity of bodies proceeds chiefly from the particular
texture, as is manifeft in gold, the elofeft and compaftelt of bodies, which is many
times heavier than we can poffibly make any parcel of earth of the fame bulk. 1
will not examine, what may be argued touching the gravity, or quality analogous
thereunto, of even celeftial bodies, from the motion of the fpots about the fun, and
from the appearing equality of the fuppofed feas in the moon ; nor confidcr, how
little thole phenomena would agree with what Sennertus prcfumcs concerning gravity.

diffufcd quality of the univcrfe, and far more general than almoft any other of thofe,
that arc to be met with in any of the chymical principles, or Ariftotelian elements ;
fince not only the air, but that vaft cxpanfion we call heaven, in compel ifon of which,
our terreftrial globe (fuppofing it were all folid) is but a point, and perhaps too,
the fun and the fixt ftars, are fluid bodies. I demand alio, from which of the chymical
principles, motion flows ; which yet is an affection of matter much more
general than any, that can be deduced from any of the three chymical principles i I
might afk the like qucftion concerning light, which is not only to be found in the
kindled fulphur of mixt bodies, but (not to mention thofe forts of rotten woods,
and rotten fifh, that fhine in the dark) in the tails of living glow-worms, and in
the vaft bodies of the fun and ftars. 1 would gladly alfo know, in which of the "three
principles, the quality, we call found, rcfidcs as in its proper fubject ; fince either
oil falling upon oil, or fpirit upon fpirit, or fait upon fait, in a great quantity, and
from a confiderable height, will make a noife, or, if you pleale, create a found,
and (that the objection may reach the AriftoteJians) fo will alio water upon water,
and earth upon earth. And I could name other qualities to be met with in divers
bodies, of which I fuppofe my adverliries will not in hafte aflign any fubject, upon
whole account it muft needs be, that the quality belongs to all the other fever*!
bodies.
And, before I proceed any further, I muft here invite you to compare the fuppofition
we are examining, with fome other of the chymical tenets. For firft they do
in effect teach, that more than one quality may belong to, and be deduced from,
one principle. For, they afcribe to Laic, taftes, and the power of coagulation s to
fulphur, as well odours as inflammablenels; and fome of them afcribe to mercury,
colours i as all of them do cffumability, as they fpcak. And on the other fide, it is
evident, that volatility belongs in common to all the three principles, and to water
too. For it is manifeft, that chymical oils arc volatile; that alfo divers falts emerging
upon the analyfis of many concretes, are very volatile, is plain from the fugitivenet's
of fait, of hartfhorn, flefh, t-iV. afcending in the diflillation of thofe bodies.
How eafily water may be made to afcend in vapours, there is fcarce any body, that
has not obferved. And as for what they call the mercurial principle of bodies, that
is fo apt to be raifed in the form of ftcam, that Paractlftu and others define it by that
aptnefs to fly up j fo that (to draw that inference by the way) it feems not, that
chymifts have been accurate in their doctrine of qualities, and their refpective principles,
fince they both derive fcveral qualities from the fame principle, and muft
alt ribc the fame quality to almoft all their principles and other bodies befides. And
thus much for the firft thing taken for granted, without fufficient proof, by your
SamertuSi and to add that upon the by (continues Carntades) we may hence learn,
Ibfljpt what to judge of the way of argumentation, which that fierce champion of the AncMkTio!

This bold difcourfe (rcfumcs Carneadest putting up again his paper) I think it
were not very difficult to confute, if his arguments were as confiderable, as our time
will probably prove Ihort for the remaining and more neccffary part of my difcourfe
:
wherefore referring you for an anfwer to what was faid concerning the difUpatcd
parts of a burnt piece of green wood, to what I told Tbeimfiius on the like occafion,
I might eafily {hew you, how (lightly and fuperficially our Guntberus talks of the
dividing the flame of green wood into his four elements •, when he makes that vapour
to be auv which being caught in glafles and condcnfcd, prefently difcovers itfclf to
have been but an aggregate of innumerable very minute drops of liquor : and when
he would prove the phlegm's being compofed of fire, by that heat, which is adventitious
to the liquors, andceafes upon the able nec of what produced it (whether that
be an agitation proceeding from the motion of the external fire, or the prefence of a
multitude of igneous atoms pervading the pores of the vefiel, and nimbly permeating
the whole body of the water) I might, I fay, urge thefc and divers other weaknefles
of his difcourfe. But I will rather take notice or what is more pertinent to the occafion
of this digreflion ; namely, that taking it for granted, that fluidity (with which
he unwarily fecms to confound humidity) mult proceed from the element of water,
he makes a chymical oil to confift of that elementary liquor ; and yet in the very
next words proves* that it confifts alio of fire, by its inflammability ; not remembering,
that exquifuely pure fpirit of wine is both more fluid than water itfclf, and yet
will flame all away, without leaving the leaft aqueous moilhire behind it, and without
fuch an amurca and foot as he would deduce the prefence of earth from. So that the
lame liquor may, according to his doctrine, be concluded by its great fluidity to be
a! moil all water ; and, by its burning all away, to be all difguifed fire. And by ttie
like way of probation our author would fhew, that the fixt fait of wood is compounded
of the four elements. For (fays he) being turned by the violence of the fire
into fleams, it ftiews itfclf to be of kin to air; whereas 1 doubt, whether he ever faw
a true, fixt fait (which to become fo, mull have already endured the violence of an incinerating
fire) brought by the fire alone to afcend in the form of exhalations; but I
do not doubt, that if he did, and had caught thofe exhalations in convenient veflcls, he
would have found them as well as the fleams of common fait, &c. ot a 1 -line, and
not an acreal nature. And whereas our author takes it alfo for granted, that the fufibility
of fait muft be deduced from water, it is indeed fo much the e&6 of heat
varioufly agitating the minute parts of a body, without regard to warer, that gold
(which by its being the heavieft and fixedeft of bo lies, (hould be the mod earthy)
will be brought to fufion by a ftrong fire, which fure is more likely to drive away,
than increafc its aqueous ingredient, if it have any. And on the other fide, for want

of a fufikient agitation of its minute parts, ice is not fluid, but folid ; though he
prcfumcs alfo, that the mordicant quality of bodies muft proceed from a fiery ingredient
: whereas, not to urge, that the light and inflammable parts, which arc the molt
likely to belong to the element of fire, muft probably be driven away by that time
the violence of the fire has reduced the body to alhes j not to urge this, I fay, nor
that oil of vitriol, which quenches fire, burns the tongue and flelh of thofe, that
unwarily tafte or apply it, as a cauftic doth, it is precarious to prove the prefence of
fire in fixt falts from their cauftic power, unlefs it were firft (hewn, that all the qualities
afcribed to falts muft be deduced from thofe of the elements ; which, had I
time, I could eafily manifeft to be no eafy tafk. And not to mention, that our author
makes a body, as homogeneous, as any he can produce for elementary, belong
both to water and fire, though it be neither fluid nor infipid, like water ; nor light
and volatile, like fire •, he feems to omit in this anatomy the element of earth, fare
that he intimates, that the fait may pafs for that : but fince a few lines before, he
takes aflies for earth, I fee not how he will avoid an inconfiftency either betwixt the
parts of his difcourfe, or betwixt fome of them and his doclrine. For fince there
is a manifeft difFcrencc betwixt the faline and the infipid parts of afties, I fee not how
fubftances, that difagree in fuch notable qualities, can be both faid to be portions of
an element, whofe nature requires that it be homogeneous, efpecially in this cafe
where an analyfis by the fire is fuppofed to have feparated it from the admixture of
other elements, which are confefled by moft Ariftotelians to be generally found in
common earth, and to render it impure. And fure, if when we have confidered,
for how little a difparity's fake the Peripatetics make thefe fymbolizing bodies, air
and fire, to be two diftinft elements, we ftiall alfo confider, that the faline part of
afhes is very ftrongly tafted, and eafily foluble in water ; whereas the other part of
the fame alhes is infipid and indifibluble in the fame liquor : not to add, that the one
fubftance is opacous, and the other fomewhat diaphanous, nor that they differ indivers
other particulars •, if we confider thofe things, I fay, we Hull hardly think,
that both thefe fubftances are elementary earth. And as to what is fometimes objected,
that their faline tafte is only an cffccl of incineration and aduftion, it has been
cli'ewhere fully replied to, when propofed by 'Tbemiftius, and where it has been proved
againft him, that however infipid earth may perhaps, by additaments, be turned into
fait, yet it is not like it (hould be fo by the fire alone i for we fee, that when we reline
gold and Giver, the violenteft fires we can employ on them give them not the
leaft rclifli of faltnefs. And I think Pbiloponus has rightly obferved, that the afhes
of fome concretes contain very little fait, if any at all : for refiners fuppofe, that
bonc-alhcs are free from it, and therefore make ufe of them for tefts and cupels \
which ought to be deftitute of fait, left the violence of the fire fhould bring them to
vitrification. And having purpolely and heedfully tafted a cupel made of only boneafhes
and fair water, which I had caufed to be expofed to a very violent fire, actuated
by the blaft of a large pair of double bellows, I could not perceive, that the force of
the fire had imparted to it the leaft faltnefs, or fo much as made it lefe infipid.
BirT (fays Carneades) fince neither you nor I love repetitions, I fhall not now make
any of what elfe was urged againft Tbemiftius, but rather invite you to take notice
with me, that when our author, though a learned man, and one that pretends flcill
enough in chymiftry to reform the whole art, comes to make good his confident undertaking,
to give us an ocular demonftration of die immediate prefence of the four
elements in the rcfolution of green wood, he is fain to fay things, that agree very
little with one another. For about the beginning of that palfage of his, lately recited

cited to you, he makes the fweat, as he call it, of the green wood, to be water ; the
fmoke, air ; the fhining matter, fire ; and the alhcs, earth : whereas a few lines after,
he will, in each of thefe, nay (as I juft now noted) in one diftinct part of the afhcs, (hew
the four elements. So that cither the former analyfis muft be incompetent to prove
that number of elements, fince by it, the burnt concrete is not reduced into elementary
bodies, but into fuch as are yet each of them compounded of the four elements -,
or clfe thefe qualities, from which he endeavours to deduce the prefence of all the
elements in the fixt fait, and each of the other feparated fubftances, will be but a
precarious way of probation ; efpecially if you confider, that the extracted alkali of
wood, being, for aught appears, at leaft as fimilar a body, as any that the Peripatetics
can (hew us, it its differing qualities muft argue the prefence of diftinct elements,
it will fcarce be pofilble for them, by any way they know of employing the
fire upon any body, to lhew, that any body is a portion of a true element. And
this recalls to my mind, that I am now but in an occafional excurfion, which aiming
only to fticw, that the Peripatetics, as well as the chymifts, take, in our prefent controverfy,
fomething for granted, which they ought to prove, I fhall return to my
exceptions, where I ended the firft of them, and further tell you, that neither is that
the only precarious thing, that I take notice of in b'ennertus his argumentation : for
when he infers, that becaufe the qualities he mentions, as colours, fmells, and the
like, belong not to the elements, they therefore muft to the chymical principles, he
takes that for granted, which will not in hafte be proved ; as 1 might here manifeft,
but that I may by and by have a fitter opportunity to take notice of it. And thus
much at prefent may fuffice to have diicourfed againft the fuppofition, that almoft
every quality muft have fome Jixt.koi. Tpww, as they fpeak, fome native receptacle,
wherein, as in its proper fubject of inhefion, it peculiarly refides ; and on whofe account
that quality belongs to the other bodies, wherein, it is to be met with. Now
this fundamental fuppofition being once deftroyed, whatfoevcr is built upon it, muft
fall to ruin of itfelf.
But I confider further, that chymifts are (for aught I have found) far from being
able to explicate by any of the tria prima> thofe qualities, which they pretend to belong
primarily unto it, and in mixt bodies to deduce from it. It is true indeed, that
fuch qualities are not explicable by the four elements •, but it will not therefore follow,
that they are fo by the three Hermetical principles : and this is it, that feems to
have deceived the chymifts, and is indeed a very common miftake amongft molt
difputants, who argue, as if there could be but two opinions concerning the difficulty
about which they content ; and confequently they infer, that if their adverfarics opinion
be erroneous, their's muft needs be the truth •, whereas many queftions, and
efpecially in matters phyfiological, may admit of fo many differing hypothefes, that
it will be very inconfiderate and fallacious to conclude (except where the opinions are
precifely contradictory) the truth of one from the falfity of another. And in our
particular cafe it is no way neceffary, that the properties of mixt bodies muft be explicable
cither by the Hermetical, or the Ariftotelian hypodiefis ; there being divers
other and more plaufiblc ways of explaining them, and cipecially that, which deduces
qualities from the motion, figure, and contrivance of the fmall parts of bodies ; as I
think might be Ihewn, if the attempt were as feafonable, as I fear it would be
tedious.
I will allow then, that the chymifts do not caufelcfsly accufe the doctrine of the
four elements of incompetency to explain the properties of compound bodies. And
for this rejection of a vulgar error, they ought not to be denied what praife men may

for exploding a doctrine, whofe imperfections are fo confpiaious, that
needed but not to (hut their eyes, to difcovcr them. But I am miftaken, if our hermetical
philofophcrs themfclvcs need not, as well as the Peripatetics, have recourfe
to more fruitful and coniprehenfivc principles than the tria prima, to make out the
properties of the bodies they converle with. Not to accumulate examples to this
purpofe, becaufc 1 hope for a fitter opportunity to profecute this fubject, let us at
prefent only point at colour, that you may guefs by what they fay of lb obvious and
familiar a quality, how little inftruction we are to expert from the tria prima in thofe
more abftrufe ones, which they, with the Ariftotclians, ftylc occult. For about colours,
neither do they at all agree among themfelves, nor have I met with any one,
of-which of the three perfuafions focver, that docs intelligibly explicate them. The
vulgar chymifts arc wont to afcribc colours to mercury •, Paraeelfus in divers places
m£; attributes them to fait ; and Senttertus, having recited their differing opinions, dificnts-
"!»• from both; and refers colours rather unto fulphur. But how colours do, nay, how
** **6,
they may, arife from either of thefe principles, I think you will fcarcc fay, that any
has yet intelligibly explicated. And if Mr. Boyle will allow me to fliew you the experiments,
which he has collected about colours, you will, I doubt not, confefs, that,
bodies exhibit colours, not upon the account of the predominancy of this or that
principle in them, but upon that of their texture, and expccially the difpofition of
their luperiicial parts ; whereby the light rebounding thence to the eye is fo modified,,
as by differing imprcflions varioufly to affect the organs of fight. I might here take
notice of the pleafing variety of colours exhibited by the triangular glafs (at it is wont
to be called) and demand, what addition or decrement of either fait, fulphur, or
mercury, befalls the body of the glafs by being prifmatically figured ; and yet it is
known, that without that lhape it would not afford thofe colours as it docs. But becaufc
it may be objected, that thefe are not real, but apparent colours , that I may
not lofe time in examining the diftinction, I will alledge againft the chymifts a couple
of examples of real and permanent colours drawn from metalline bodies ; and reprefent,
that without the addition of any extraneous body, , quickfilver may by the
fire alone, and that in glals-veflels, be deprived of its filvcr-likc colour, and be turned
into a red body •, and from this red body without addition likewife may be obtained
a mercury bright and fpecular as it was before. So that I have here a lafting colour
generated and deftroyed (as I have fcen) at pleafure, without adding or taking away
either mercury, fait, or fulphur. And if you take a clean and flendcr piece of
hardened fteel, and apply to it the flame of a candle at fome little diftance fhort of the
point, you fhall not liave held the fteel long in the flame, but you fhall perceive
divers colours, as yellow, red and blue, to appear upon the furface of the metal,
and, as it were, run along in chafe of one another towards the point •, fo that the
fame body, and that in one and the fame parr, may not only have a new colour produced
in it, but exhibit fucceflively divers colours within a minute of an hour, or
thereabouts ; and any of thefe colours may, by removing the fteel from the fire, become
permanent, and laft many years. And this production and variety of colours
cannot reasonably be fuppofed to proceed from the acccfiion of any of the three
principles, to which of them focver chymifts will be pleafed to afcribe colours ; efpecially
confidering, that if you but fuddenly refrigerate that iron, firft made red-hot,
it will be hardened and colourlefs again ; and not only by the flame of a candle, but
by any other equivalent heat conveniently applied, the like colours will again be
made to appear and lucceed one another, as at the firft. But I muft not any further
profecute an, occafional difcourfe,. though that were not fo diificult for mc to do, as I

their principles, than they have done of colours. And your Settntrtus himfelf «*»»• *
(though an author I much value) would I fear have been exceedingly puzzled to^,6
^
refolve, by the tria prima, half that catalogue of problems, which he challenges the '*$,
vulgar Peripatetics to explicate by their four elements. And fuppofing it were true,
that fait or lulphur were the principle, to which this or that quality may be peculiarly
referred, yet though he, that teaches us this, teaches us fomething concerning that
quality, yet he teaches us but fomething. For indeed he docs not teach us that, which
can in any tolerable meafurc fatisfy an inquifitive' fearcher after truth. For what is
it to mc to know, that liich a quality refides in fuch a principle or clement, whilft I
remain altogether ignorant of the caufe of that quality, and the manner of its production
and operation ? How little do I know more than any ordinary man of gravity,
if I know but that the heavinefs of mixt bodu-s proceeds from that of the earth
they are compoted of, if I know not the rcafon, why the earth is heavy ? and how
little docs the chymift teach the philofopher of the nature of purgation, if he only
tells him, that the purgative virtue of medicines refides in their fait? For, befides
that this mull not be conceded without limitation, fince the purging parts of many
vegetables extracted by the water, wherein they are infufed, arc at mod but fuch
compounded fa Its (I mean mingled with oil, and fpirir, and earth, as tartar and
divers other fubjects of the vegetable kingdom afford j) and fince too that quickfilvcr
precipitated either with gold, or without addition, into a powder, is wont to be
ftrongly enough cathartical, though the chymifts have not yet proved, that either
gold or mercury have any fait at all, much left any that is purgative i befides this, I
fay, how little is it to me, to know, that it is the fait of the rhubarb (for inftance)
that purges, if I find, that it dots not purge as fait -, fince fcarce any elementary fait
is in fmall quantity cathartical ; and if I know not how purgation in general is effected
in a human body ? In a word, as it is one thing to know a man's lodging, and
another, to be acquainted with him \ fo it may be one thing to know the fubjccV
wherein a quality principally refides, and another thing to have a right notion and
knowledge of the quality itfclf. Now that, which I take to be the reafon of this
chymical deficiency, is the fame, upon whofe account I think the Ariftotclian and
divers other theories incompetent to explicate the origin of qualities. For I am apt
to think, that men will never be able to explain the phasnomcna of nature, while
they endeavour to deduce them only from the prefencc and proportion of fuch or
fuch material ingredients, and confider fuch ingredients or elements as bodies in a
ftate of reft ; whereas indeed the greateft part of the affections of matter, and confequently
of the phenomena of nature, feems to depend upon the motion and the
contrivance of the fmall parts of bodies. For it is by motion, that one part of matter
ads upon another i and it is, for the moftpart, the texture of the body, upon which
the moving parts ftrike, that modifies the motion or impreffion, and concurs withit
to the production of thofe effects, which make up the chief part of the naturalift's
theme.
But (fays Ekvtbcrius) methinks for all this* you have left fome part of what I
'
alleged, in behalf of the three principles, unanfwcrcd. For all that you have faid
will not keep this from being a ufeful difcovery, that fince in the fait of one concrete,
in the fulphur of another, and the mercury of a third, the medicinal virtue of it
refides i that principle ought to be fcparated from the reft, and there the defired fatality
mult be fought for. .

I never denied (replies Carneades) that the notion of the tria prima may be of fome
ufc i but (continues he, laughing) by what you now allege for it, it will but appear,
that it is ufeful to apothecaries, rather than to philofophers \ the being able to make
things operative being fufficient to thole, whereas the knowledge of caufes is the
thing looked after by thefe. And let me tell you, Eleutbcriust even this itfelf will
need to be entertained with fome caution.
For firft, it will not prefently follow, that if the purgative or other virtue of a
fimple may be eafily extracted by water or fpirit of wine, it rcfides in the fait or fulphur
of the concrete ; fince unlefs the body hath before been refolved by the fire, or
lome other powerful agent, it will, for the mod part, afford in the liquors I have
named, rather the finer compounded parts of itfelf, than the elementary ones. . As
I noted before, that water will difiblve not only pure falts, but cryftals of tartar,
gum arabic, myrrh and other compound bodies. As alfo fpirit of wine will difiblve
not only the pure fulphur of concretes, but likewife the whole fubftance of divers
rcfinous bodies, as benzoin, the gummous parts of jalap, gum lacca, and other
bodies, that are counted perfectly mixt. And we fee, that the extracts made either
with water or fpirit of wine are not of a fimple and elementary nature, but mafifes
confifting of the loofer corpufclcs, and finer parts of the concretes whence they are
drawn ; fince by difiillation they may be divided into more elementary fubftances.
Next, we may confider, that even when there intervenes a chymical refolution by
the fire, it is feldom in the faline or fulphurcous principle, as fuch, that the defired
faculty of the concrete refides ; but as that titular fait or fulphur is yet a mixt body,
though the faline or fulphureous nature be prcdominent in it. For, if in chymical
reiblutions, the leparated fubftances were pure and fimple bodies, and of a perfect
elementary nature j no one would be indued with more fpecific virtues, than another j
and their qualities would differ as little as do thofc of water. And let me add this
upon the by, that even eminent chymills have differed themfelves to be reprehended
by me for their over-great diligence in purifying fome of the things they obtain by
lire from mixt bodies. For though fuch compleatly purified ingredients of bodies
might perhaps be more fatisfactory to our undcrftanding, yet others are often more
ufeful to our lives; the efficacy of fuch chymical productions depending moft upon
what they retain of the bodies, whence they are feparated, or gain by the new aflbciations
of the difiipated among themfelves ; whereas, if they were meerly elementary,
their ufes would be comparatively very fmall j and the virtues of fulphurs, falts,
or other fuch fubftances of one denomination, would be the very fame.
Ano by the way, Eieufberius, I am inclined upon this ground to think, that the
artilicial refolution of compound bodies by fire does not fo much enrich mankind, as
it divides them into their fuppofed principles as upon the fcore of its making new
compounds by new combinations of the diffipatcd parts of the refolved body. For
by this means the number of mixt bodies is considerably increafed ; and many of
thole new productions are endowed with ufeful qualities ; divers of which they owe
not to the body, from which they were obtained, but to their newly-acquired
texture.
Eur thirdly, that, which ^principally to be noted, is this, that as there are divers
concretes, whofe faculties refidc in fome one or other of thofc differing fubftances, that
diymifts call their fulphurs, falts, and mercuries ; and confequently may be beft
obtained, by analyzing the concrete, whereby the defired principles may be had fevered
or freed from the reft ; fo there are others, wherein the nobleft properties lodge
•not in the fair, or fulphur, or mercury, but depend immediately upon the form, or

(if you will) refult from the determinate ftru&ure of the whole concrete ; and confequently
they, that go about to extract the virtues of fuch bodies, by expofing them
to the violence of the fire, do exceedingly miftakc, and take the way to deftroy what
they would obtain.
I remember that Helmont himfelf fomewhere confefies, that as the fire betters
fome things, and improves their virtues, fo it fpoils others, and makes them degenerate.
And elfewhere he judicioufly affirms, that there may be lbmetimes greater
virtue in a fimple, fuch as nature has made it, than in any thing, that can by the
fire be leparated from it. And left you mould doubt, whether he means by the virtues
of things thofe, that are medical j he has in one place this ingenuous confeflion ;
Credo (fays he) Jimplicia in fua Jimplicitate ejfe fufficiemia pro fanatione omnium morlorum.
Nay, Bartbius, even in a comment upon Beguinust fcruples not to make this acknowledgment

uniones, corallia, mofeus, ambra, &c. Confonantly whereunto he alfo tells us (and X J*
vouches the famous Platerus, for having candidly given the fame advertifemcnt to
his auditors) that fome things have greater virtues, and better fuited to our human
nature, when unprepared, than when they have paft the chymifts fire : as wc fee, faysmy
author, in pepper i of which fome grains fwallowed perform more towards the
relief of a diftempercd ftomach, than a great quantity of the oil of the fame
fpice.
It has been (purfues Carneades) by our friend here prcfent obferved concerning'
lalt-petre, that none of the fubftances, into which the fire is wont to divide it, retains
either the tafte, the cooling virtue, or fome other of the properties of the concrete
and that each of thofe fubftances acquires new qualities not to be found in falt-petre
itfelf. The fhining property of the tails of glow-worms does furvive but fo Ihort a
time the little animal made confpicuous by it, that inquifitive men have not fcrupled
publickly to deride Baptifta Porta and others ; who, deluded perhaps with fome chy- •
mical furmifes, have ventured to prefcribe the diftillation of a water from the tails of
glow-worms, as a fure way to obtain a liquor fhining in the dark. To which I ftiall
:
now add no other example than that afforded us by amber ; which, whilft it remains
an intire body, is endowed with an electrical faculty of drawing to itfelf feathers,
ftraws, and fuch like bodies ; which I never could obferve cither in its fait, its fpirit,
its oil, or in the body I remember I once made by the re-union of its divided elements
i none of thefe having fuch a texture as the intire concrete. And however
chymifts boldly deduce fuch and fuch properties from this or that proportion of their
component principles ; yet in concretes, that abound with this or that ingredient, it •
is not always fo much by virtue of its prefence, nor its plenty, that the concrete is
qualified to perform fuch and fuch effects •, as upon the account of the particular
texture of that and the other ingredients, affociated after a determinate manner into
one concrete-, though poflibly luch a proportion of that ingredient may be more convenient
than another, for the conftituting of fuch a body. Thus in a clock, the hand
is moved upon the dial, the bell is ftruck, and the other actions belonging to the
engine are performed, not becaufe the wheels arc of brafs or iron, or part of one
metal and part of another, or becaufe the weights are of lead ; but by virtue of the
ftze, fhape, bignefs, and coaptation of the feveral parts -, which would perform the
fame things, though the wheels were of filvcr, or lead, or wood, and the weights of'
ftonc or clay, provided the fabric or contrivance of the engine were the fame : though

it be not to be denied, that brafs and fteel are more convenient materials to make
clock-wheels of, than lead, or wood. And to let you fee, Eleutberius* that it is
fomctimes at leaft, upon the texture of the fmall parts of a body, and not always
upon the prefence, or recefs, or increafe, or decrement of any one of its principles,
that it may lofe fome fuch qualities, and acquire fome fuch others, as arc thought
-very ftrongly inherent to the bodies they refide in j I will add to what may, from
my paft tiilcourfe, be referred to this purpofe, this notable example, from my own
experience ; that lead may, without any additament, and only by various applications
of the fire, lofe its colour •, and acquire fomctimes a grey, lometimes a ycljowifh,
fomctimes a red, fometimes an amethyftine colour j and after having part through
xhefc, and perhaps divers others, again recover its leaden colour, and be made a
^bright body. That alfo this lead, which is fo flexible a metal* may be made as brittle
us glafs, and prefently be brought to be again flexible and malleable as before, And
befides that the fame lead, which I find by microfcopes to be one of the moll opaxous
bodies in the world, may be reduced to a fine tranfparent glafs ; whence yet it
may return to an opacous nature again i and all this, as 1 faid, without the addition
of any extraneous body, and meerly by the manner and method of expofing it to
*he fire.
But (fays Carneades ) after having already put you to fo prolix a trouble, it is,
ximc for me to relieve you with a promifc of putting fpeedily a period to it •, and to
make good that promife, I fhall, from all that I have hitherto difcourfed with you,
.deduce but this one propofition by way of corollary : That it may as yet be doubted,
whether or no there beany determinate number of elements ; or, if you pleafe, whether or
no all compound bodies do. confifi cf the fame number of elementary ingredients or material
principles.
This being but an inference from the foregoing difcourfe, it will not be requifite
.t<> inGft at large on the proofs of it , but only to point at the chief of them* and
refer you for particulars to what has been already delivered.
In the :irft place then, from what has been fo largely difcourfed, it may appear,
that the experiments wont to be brought, whether by the common Peripatetics, or
by the vulgar chymifts, to demonftrate, that all mixt bodies arc made up prccifcly
-either of the four elements, or the three hypoftatical principles, do not evince what
they are alleged to prove. And as for the other common arguments, pretended to
be drawn from reafon in favour of the Ariftotelian hypothefis (for the chymifts arc
wont to rely almoft altogether upon experiments ;) they arc commonly grounded upon
iiich unreaibnable or precarious fuppofitions, that it is altogether as eafy and as juft
for any man to rcjeft them, as for thofe, that take them for granted, to afTert them,
being indeed all of them as indemonftrable as the conclufion to be inferred from
them i and fome of them fo manifeftly weak and prooflefs, that he muft be a very
courteous adverfary, that can be willing to grant them i and as unfkilful a one, that
cm be compelled to do fo.
In the next place, it may be coofidercd, if what thofe patriarchs of the Spagyrifls,
Taracelfus and Helmont, do on divers occafions pofitively deliver, be true ; namely,
that the alkaheft does refolve all mixt bodies into other principles than the fire, it
mull be decided, which of the two resolutions (that made by the alkaheft* or that
made by the fire) fhall determine the number of the elements, before we can be
certain how many there arc.
And in the mean time, we may take notice in the laft place, that as the diftinct
Albftances, whercinto the alkaheft divides bodies, are affirmed to be differing in nature

from foinc bodies more in number than from fomc others ; fincc he tells us, he could
totally reduce all forts of ftones into fait only, whereas of a coal he had two diftinct
liquors: fo, although wc 'mould acquiefce in that refolution which is made by fire,
we find not, that all mixt bodies are thereby divided into the fame number of elements
and principles ; fomc concretes afFording more of them than others do; nay,
anil fometimcs this or that body affording a greater number of differing fubftances by
one way of management, than the fame yields by another. And diey, that out of
gold, or mercury, or A/v/frvy-glafs, will draw me as many diftinct fubftances, as I
can feparate from vitriol, or from the juice of grapes varioufly ordered, may teach
me that, which I lhall very thankfully learn. Nor does it appear more congruous
to that variety, that fo much conduceth to the perfection of the univerfe, that all
elemented bodies be compounded of the fame number of elements, than it would
be for a language, that all its words mould confift of the fame number of letters.

Carneadis having in vain reprefented, that their lcifurc could be but very (horfr
that he had already prated very long, that he was unprepared to maintain fo great
and lo invidious a paradox, was at length prevailed with to tell his friend , fince,
Slatiberiusy y ou will have me difcourfe exiempere of the paradox you mention, I am
content (though more perhaps to cxprefe my obedience, than my opinion) to tell you,
that (iuppoling the truth of Ilelmont's and Paracel/us's alkaheftical experiments, if I
may fo call them) though it may icem extravagant, yet it is not abfurd to doubt,
whether, for aught has been proved, there be a necelfity to admit any elements, or
hypoilatical principles, at all.
And, as formerly, fo now, to avoid the necdlefe trouble of difputing fevcrally with
the Ariftotdians and the chymilts, I will addrd's myfclf to oppofe them I have lafl:
named, becaute their doclrinc about the elements is more applauded by the moderns,
as pretending highly to be grounded upon experience. And, to deal not only fairly,
but favourably with them, I will allow them to take in earth and water to their other
principles. Which I confcnt to the rather, that my difcourfe may the better reach
the tenets of the Peripatetics ; who cannot plead for any fo probably, as for thofc
two elements ; that of fire above the air being generally by judicious men exploded
as an imaginary thing ; and the air not concurring to compofe mixt bodies as one of
their elements, but only lodging in their pores, or rather replenilhing, by rcafon of
its weight and fluidity, all thofc cavities or bodies here below, whether compounded
or not, that arc big enough to admit it, and are not filled up with any groflcr fubitance.
And, to prevent miftakes, I mull advertifc you, that I now mean by elements,
as thole chymifts, that ipeak plaineft, do by their principles, certain primitive and
fimple, or perfectly unminglcd bodies j which not being made of any other bodies,
or of one another, arc the ingredients, of which all thofc called perfectly mixt bodies
arc immediately compounded, and into which they are ultimately refolved: now
whether there be any one fuch body to be conftantly met with in all, and each, of
thefe, that are faid to be elemented bodies, is the thing I now qucftion.
By this ftate of the controverfy you will, I fuppole, guefs, that I need not be fo
abfurd, as to deny, that there are fuch bodies as earth and water, and quickfdver and
fulphur : but I look upon earth- and water, as component parts of the univerfe, or
remptorily deny, that there may fometimes cither a running mercury, or a combuilible
fubftance be obtained from a mineral, or even a metal ; yet I need not concede
either of them to be an clement in the fenfc above declared j as I (hall have occafion
to (hew you by and by.
To give you then a brief account of the grounds I intend to proceed upon, I
muft tell you, thnt in matters of philofophy, this feems to me a fufficicnt reafon to
doubt of a known and important propofuion, that the trutli of it is not yet by any
competent proof made to appear. And congruoufly hereunto, if I (hew, that the
grounds, upon which men are perfuaded, that there are elements, arc unable to
fatisry a confidcring man, I fuppole my doubts will appear rational.
Now the considerations, that induce men to think, that there are elements, may be
conveniently enough referred to two heads : namely, the one, that it is necefiary,
that nature make ule of elements to conftitute the bodies that are reputed mixt. And
the other, that the refolution of fuch bodies manifefts, that nature had compounded

He Sceptical Chvmist.
Is reference to the former of thefe confiderations, there are two or three things,
that I have to reprefent. And I will begin with reminding you of the experiments
I not long fince related to you concerning the growth of pompions, mint, and other
vegetables out of fair water. For by thofc experiments it fcems evident, that water
may be tranfmuted into all the other elements ; from whence it may be inferred, bod),
that it is not every thing chymifls will call fait, fulphur, or lpirit, that needs always
be a primordiate and ingene'rable body ; and that nature may contex a plant (though
that be a perfectly mixt concrete) without having all the elements prcviouily prefented
to her to compound it of. And, if you will allow the relation I mentioned out of
Monfieur dt Rocbai to be true; then may not only plants, but animals and minerals
too, be produced out ofwater. And however there is little doubt to be made, but th t
the plants my trials afforded me, as they were like in fo many other relpects to the retl c f
the plants of the fame denomination \ fo they would, in cafe I had reduced them to putrefaction,
have likewife produced worms or other infedts, as well as the rcfembling
vegetables are wont to do : fo that water may, by various fcminal principles, be fucccflively
tranfmuted into both plants and animals. And if we confider, that not only
men, but even fucking children are, but too often, tormented with folid llones ; and
that divers forts of beafls themfclvcs (whatever Helmont againft experience thinks to
the contrary) may be troubled with great and heavy flones in their kidneys and bladders,
though they feed but upon grafs and other vegetables, that are perhaps but
difguifed water •, it will not fcem improbable, that even fomc concretes of a mineral
nature may likewife be formed of water.
We may further take notice, that as a plant may be nourifhed, and confequcntly
may confilt of common water; fo may both plants and animals (perhaps even from
their feminal rudiments) confift of compound bodies, without having any thing
merely elementary brought them by nature to be compounded by them : this is evident
in divers men, who whillt they were infants were fed only with milk, afterwards
live together upon flefh, fifh, wine, and other perfectly mixt bodies. It may be
feen alio in Ihecp, who, on fome of our Englifh downs or plains, grow very tat .by
feeding upon the grafs, without fcarcc drinking at all and yet morn manifeftly in
the maggots, that breed and grow up to their full bignefs within the pulps of apple s,
pears, or the like fruit. We fee alfo, that dungs, that abound with a mixt fait, give
a much more fpeedy increment to corn and other vegetables, than water alone would
do : and it hath been allured me by a man experienced in fuch matters, that ibmctimcs,
when, to bring up roots very early, the mould they were planted in was made
over-rich, the very Jubilance of the plant has tafled of the dun<z;. And let US alfo
confider a graft of one kind of fruit upon the upper bougli of a tree of another
kind ; as (for inftance) the fcion of a pear upon a white-thorn ; for there the amending
liquor is already altered, either by the root, or in its afcent by the bark, or bo:h
ways, and becomes a new mixt body : as may appear by the differing qualities to be
met with in the faps of feveral trees ; as particularly, the medicinal virtue of birchwater,
which I have ibmetimes drunk upon HtlmonC% great and not undeferved commendation.
Now the graft, being fattened to the llotk, mud neceuarily nourifh itfelf,
and produce its fruit, only out of this compound juice prepared for it by the
flock, being unable to come at any other aliment. And if we confider, how much of
the vegetable he feeds upon may (as wc noted above) remain in an animal •, we may
eafily luppofe, that the blood of that animal, who feeds upon this, though it be a
wcll-conllituted liquor, and have all the differing corpufcles, that make it up, kept

in order by one prcfiding form, may be a (trangely decompounded body, many ofits
parts being themfclves decompounded. So little is it neceflary, thac even in the
mixtures, which nature herfclf makes in animal and vegetable bodies, ihc (hould
have pure elements at hand to make her compoQtions of.
Having laid thus much touching the conftitution of plants and animals, I might
perhaps be able to lay as much touching that of minerals, and even metals, ir is
were as eafy for us to make experiment in order to the production of thtfc, as of
thofe. But the growth or increment of minerals being ulually a work of txcell'.vely
long time, and for the molt part performed in the bowels of the earth, where we
cannot fee it, I mud mftead of experiments make ufe, on this occafion, of obfervations.
That (tones were not all made at once, but that ibme of them are now-a days
generated, may (though it be denied by fome) be fully proved by icvcral example^,
of which I (hall now fcarce alledgc any other, than that famous place in kratttt
known by the name of Lis Caves Gouticm, where the water falling from the upper
parts of the cave to the ground, dots prelently there condenie imo little (tones, of
fuch figures, as the drops, falling either leverally or upon one another, and coagulating
prelently into (lone, chance to exhibit. Of thefe (tones fome ingenious friends
of ours, that went a while fincc to vifit that place, did mc the favour to prefent me
with fome, that they brought thence. And I remember, that both that iober relator
of his voyages, Van Linfcbotcn^ and another good author, inform us, that in the
diamond mines (as they call them) in the Eajl-Iftdies, when having digged the earth,
though to no great depth, they find diamonds, and take them qi.ite away ; yet in a
very few years they find in the fame place new diamonds produced tliere fincc. i-'rota
both which relations, efpecially the firfl, it fccnis probable, that nature does not
always ltay for divers elementary bodies, when (he is to produce (lores. And as lor
metals themfelves, authors of good note allure us, that even they were not in the
beginning produced at once altogether, but have been obferved to grow ; fo that
what was not a mineral or metal before, became one afterwards. Of this it were eafy
to alledgc many teltimonies of profefled chy milts. But that they may have the
greater authority, I (hall rather prefent you with a few borrowed from more unfufpedtcd
writers : Sulpburis mineram (as the inouifitive P. Fallopius notes) qua uutrix eft

which the iron of that ifland yielded the duke of Florence in his time; but is mentioned
more exprefsly to our purpofe by the learned Cefalpimis : Vena (fays he) ferri

becaufe from thence we may deduce, that earth, by a metalline plailick principle
latent in it, may be in procefs of time changed into a metal. And even • Agriccla

Not to mention this, I fay, Boccaaus Certcldus, as 1 find him quoted by a diligent

Tin other two relations I have not met with in Latin authors, and yet they are
both very memorable in thcmielvcs, and pertinent to our prefent purpofc.
The Grit I met with in the commentary of Johannes i alebius upon the Kleine Baur,
in which that inuuftrious chymift relates, with imny circumilances, that at a minetown
(if I may fo Eagli'h the German Bergjlit) right miles or leagues diftant from
Strtijlurg called Marnsktrcb, a workman came to the overieer, and defired employment
; Luc he telling him, that there was not any of the bell fort at prefent for him,
added, that till he could be preferred to lomc Inch, lie might in the mean time, to
av oid i itncls, work in a grove or mine pit dicreabouts, which at that time was little
ftc'-med. This workman, alter fonie weeks labour, had by a crack appearing in
the (tone upon a itroke given near the wall, an invitation given him to work his way
through; which as loon as he had done, hii eyes were faulted by a mighty (tone or
lump, which ftood in the middle of the cleft (that had a hollow place behind it)
upright, and in fhew like an armed man ; but confuted of pure fine lilver having no
vein or ore by it, or any other additament, but ftood there free, having only under
foot fomething like a burnt matter ; and yet this one lump held in weight above
1000 marks, which, according to the Dutch account, makes 500 pound weight of
fine iilver. From which and other circumftanccs my author gathers, that by the
warmth of the place, the noble metalline i'pirits, (fulphurcous and mercurial) were
carried from the neighbouring galleries or vaults, through other Imaller crack 1
; and
clefts into that cavity, that there collected as in a clofe chamber or cellar; whereinto
when they were gotten, they did in procefs of time fettle into the fore-mentioned
precious mal's of metal.

The other German relation is of that great traveller and laborious chymift 'Joannes
(not Georgius) Agricola; who, in his notes upon what Poppius .has written of antimony,
relates, that when he was among the Hungarian mines in the deep groves,
he obferved, that there would often arifc in them a warm (team, (not of that malignant
fort, which the Germans call Sbwadt, which, fays he, is a mere poifon, and
often fuffbeates the diggers) which faftened itfelf to the walls ; and that coming
again to review it after a couple of days, he difcerned, that it was all very fall, and
glittering : whereupon, having collected it and diftillcd it per retortam, he obtained
from it a fine fpirit ; adding, that the mine-men informed him, that this lteam or
damp (as the Englifhmen alfo call it, retaining the Dutch term) would at laft have
become a metal, as gold or filver.
I refer (fays Ccrneades) to another occafion, the ufc that may be made of thefe
narratives towards the explicating the nature of metals ; and that of fixed nets, malleablcnei's,
and fome other qualities confpicuous in them. And in the mean time,
this 1 may at prefent deduce from thefe obfervations \ that it is not very probable,
that whenlbever a mineral, or even a metal, is to be generated in the bowels of the
earth, nature needs to have at hand both fait and fulphur, and mercury to compound
it of : for, not to urge, that the two laft relations fecm lefs to favour the chymifts
than Arifiotk, who would have metals generated of certain halitus or fteams, the
lore-mentioned obfervations together make it feem more likely, that the mineral
earths, or thole metalline fteams (wherewith probably fuch earths are plentifully
imbued) do contain in them fome feminal rudiment, or fomething equivalent thereunto
, by whofe plaltick power the reft of the matter, though perhaps tcrreftrial and
heavy, is, in tract of time, falhioned into this or that metalline ore-, almoft (as I
formerly noted) as that fair water was by the feminal principle of mint, pompions,
and other vegetables, contrived into bodies anfwerable to fuch feeds. And that fuch
alterations of tcrreftrial matter are not impoffible, feems evident from that notable
practice of the boilers of falt-petre, who unanimoufly obferve, as wejl here in England
as in other countries, that if an earth pregnant with nitre be deprived, by the affufion
vf water, of all its true and difibluble fait, yet the earth will, after fome years, yield
them fait petrc again : for which reafon, fome of the eminent and (kilfulleft of them
keep it in heaps as a perpetual mine of falt-petre. Whence it may appear, that the
feminal principle of nitre, latent in the earth, does, by degrees, transform the neighbouring
matter into a nitrous body : for though I deny, that fome volatile nitre
may, by fuch earths, be attraded (as they fpeak) out of the air, yet that the inner
-
molt parts of fuch great heaps, that lie fo remote from the air, mould borrow from
it all the nitre they abound with, is not probable, for other rcafons befides the rcmorenefs
of the air, though I have not the lcifure to mention th^-m.
And I remember, that a perfon of great credit, and well acquainted with the
ways of making vitriol, affirmed to me, that he had obferved, that a kind of mineral,
which abounds in that fait, being kept within doors, and not cxpofed (as is
tifual) to the free air and rains, did ot itfelf in no very long time turn into vitriol,
not only in the outward or fupcrficial, but even in the internal and molt central
parts.
And I alfo remember, that I met with a certain kind of marchafite, that lay together
h great quantities under ground, which did, even in my chamber, in fo tew
hours begin of itfelf to turn into vitriol, that we need not diftrult the newly
recited narrative. But to return to what I was faying of nitrc •, as nature made this

•very (linking and corroGve acid liquor, and a (harp alcalizate fait to compound it of,
though thcfe be the bodies, into which the fire d'uTolves it j fo it were not ncceflary,
that nature fhould make up all metals and other minerals of pre-cxiftent fait, and fulpluir,
and mercury, though luch bodies might by fire be obtained from it. Which
one consideration duly weighed is very confidcrable in the preientcontroverfy : and to
this agree well the relations of our two German chymifts j for befides that it cannot
be convincingly proved, it is not fo much as likely, that fo languid and moderate a
heat, as that within the mines, (hould carry up to fo great a height, though in the
form of fumes, fait, fulphur, and mercury •, fince wc find in our diftillations, that it
requires a confiderable degree of fire to raife, fo much as to the height of one foot,
not only fait, but even mercury itfclf in clofe vcficls. And if it be objected, that
it feems by the ftink, that is fometimes obferved, when lightning falls down here
below, that fulphureous fleams may afcend very high without any extraordinary
degree of heat; it may be anfwered, among other things, that the fulphur of filver
is by chymifts faid to be a fixt fulphur, though not altogether fo well dlgefted as that
of gold.
But (proceeds Carneades) if it had not been to afford you fome hints concerning
the origin of metals, I need not have deduced any thing from thefe obfervations ; ic
not being neceffary to the validity of my argument, that my deductions from them
Ihould be irrefragable, becaufe my adverfaries the Ariftotclians and vulgar chymifts
do not, I prefume, know any better than 1, a priori, of what ingredients Nature
compounds metals and minerals. For their argument to prove, that thofe bodies are
made up of fuch principles, is drawn a pqfteriori; 1 mean from this, that upon the
analyfis of mineral bodies they arc refolved into thofe differing fubftances. That we
may therefore examine this argument, let us proceed to confider, what can be
alledged in behalf of the elements from the refolutions of bodies by the fire ; which
you remember was the fecond topick, whence I told you the arguments of my adverfaries
were defumed.
And that I may firft difpatch what I have to fay concerning minerals, I will begin
the remaining part of my difcourfe with considering how the fire divides them.
And firft, I have partly noted above, that though chymifts pretend from fome to
draw fait, from others running mercury, and from others a fulphur j yet they have not
hitherto taught us, by any way in tub among them, to fcparate any one principle,
whether fait, fulphur, or mercury, from all forts of minerals without exception.
And thence I may be allowed to conclude, that there is not any of the elements, that
is an ingredient of all bodies, fince there arc fome, of which it is not fo.
In the next place, fuppofing, that either fulphur or mercury were obtainable from
all forts of minerals ; yet ftill this fulphur or mercury would be but a compounded,
not an elementary body, as 1 told you already on another occafion. And certainly
he, that takes notice of the wonderful operations of quickfilver, whether it be common,
or drawn from mineral bodies, can fcarce be fo inconsiderate as to think it of
the very fame nature with that immature and fugitive fubftance, which in vegetables
and animals chymifts have been pleafcd to call their mercury. So that when mercury
is got by the help of the fire out of a metal or other mineral body, if wc will not
fuppofe, that it was not pre-exiftent in it, but produced by the attion of the fire upon
the concrete, we may at leaft fuppofe this quickfilver to have been a perfect body of
its own kind (though perhaps lels heterogeneous than more fecondary mixts) which
happened to be mingled per minima, and coagulated with the other fubftances, wherecf
the metal or mineral coniirted. As may be exemplified, partly by native vermilion,

wherein the quickfilver and fulphur being cxquifitely blended both with one another,
and that other coarfe mineral ftufF (whatever it be) that harbours them, make up a
red body differing enough from both ; and yet from which part of quickfilver, and
of the fulphur, maybe eafdy enough obtained; partly by thofe mines, wherein
nature has fo curiouily incorporated filver with lead, that it is extremely difficult, and
yet poffible to feparate the former out of the latter •, and partly too by native vitriol,
wherein the metalline corpufekrs arc by {kill and indullry leparablc from the feline
ones, though they be fo con-coagulated with them, that the whole concrete is reckoned
a nong falts.
And here I further obferve, that I never could fee any earth or water, properly
fo called, feparatcd from cither gold or filver, (to name now no other metalline
bodies •,) and therefore to retort the argument upon my adversaries, I may conclude,
that fince there are fome bodies, in which, for aught appears, there is neither earth
nor water I may be allowed to conclude, that neither of thofe two is an univerfal
ingredient of all thofe bodies, that are counted perfectly mixt, which 1 defire you
would remember againft anon.
It may indeed be objected, that the reafon, why from gold or filver we cannot
feparate any moifture, is, becaufe that when it is melted out of the ore, the vehement
fire requifite to its fufion forced away all the aqueous and fugitive moifture ; and the
like fire may do from the materials of gljfs. To which I fhall anfwer, that I remember
I read not long fince in die learned Jcfepbus Accjla •, who relates it upon his own
obfervation, that in Anerica (where he long lived) there is a kind of filver, which
the Indians call^/w, and fometimes (fays he) they find pieces vt ry fine and pure like
to fmall round roots, the which is rare in that metal, but ufual in gold ; concerning
which metal he tells us, that befides this they find fome, which they call gold in
grains, which he tells us are fmall morfels of gold, that they find whole without
mixture of any other metal, which hath no need of melting or refining in the fire.
I remember, that a very fkilful and credible perfon affirmed to me, that being i;i
the Hungarian mines he had the good fortune to fee a mineral, that was there digged
up, wherein pieces of gold of the length, and alio almoft of the bignefs of a human
finger, grew in the ore, as if they had been parts and branches of trees.
And I have myfelf fccn a lump of whitifti mineral, that was brought as a rarity
to a great and knowing prince, wherein there grew here and there in the ftone, which
looked like a kind or fpar, divers little lumps of fine gold, (for fuch I was allured
that trial had manifefted it to be) fome of them feeming to be about the bignefs of
peas.
But that is nothing to what our Ac/la f fubjoins, which is indeed very memorable
| namely, that of the morfels of native and pure gold, which we lately heard
him mentioning, he had now and then feen fome weighed many pounds : to which
1 fhall add, that I myfelf have fccn a lump of ore not long fince digged up, in whole
ftony part there grew, almoft like trees, divers parcels, though not of gold, yet of
(what perhaps mincralifts will more wonder at) another metal, which feemcd to be
very pure or unmixt with any heterogeneous fubftances, and were fome of them as
big as my finger, if not bigger. But upon obfervations of this kind, though perhaps
I could, yet I muft not at prefenr, dwell any longer.

To proceed therefore now (fays Carneadts) to the confideration of the analyfis of
vegetables, although my trials give me no caufe to doubt, but that out of moft of
them five differing fubftances may be obtained by the fire, yet I think it will not be
fo eafily demonftrated, that thefe deferve to be called elements in the notion above
explained.
And before I defcend to particulars, I fhall repeat and premife this general confideration,
that thefe differing fubftances, that are called elements or principles, differ
not from each other as metals, plants, and animals, or as fuch creatures as arc immediately
produced each by its peculiar feed, and conftitutcs a diftinct propagab'c fort of
creatures in the univerfe ; but thefe are only various fchemes of matter or fubftances,
that differ from each other, but in confiftence (as running mercury and the fame metal
congealed by the vapour of lead) and fome very few other accidents, as taftc, or
fmell, or inflammability, or the want of them. So that by a change of texture, not
impoffible to be wrought by the fire and other agents, that have the faculty, not only
to diffociate the fmall parts of bodies, but afterwards to conned them after a new
manner, the fame parcel of matter may acquire or lofe fuch accidents, as may fuffice
to denominate it fait, or fulphur, or earth. If I were fully to clear to you my apprchenfions
concerning this matter, I fhould perhaps be obliged to acquaint you with
divers of the conjectures (for I muft yet call them no more) I have had concerning
the principles of things purely corporeal : for though, becaufe I fecm not fatisficd
with the vulgar doctrines, either of the Peripatetic or Paracelfian fchools many of
thofe, that know me (and perhaps among them, Eleutberius himfelf) have thought
me wedded to the Epicurean hypothefis (as others have miftaken me for an Hclmontian)
yet if you knew how little converfant I have been with Epicurean authors, and
how great a part of Lucretius himfelf I never yet had the curiofity to read, you
would perchance be of another mind : efpecially if I were to entertain you at large,
I fay not with my prefent notions, but with my former thoughts concerning the
principles of things. But, as I faid above, fully to clear my apprehenfions would
require a longer difcourfe than we can now have.
For I fhould tell you, that I have fometimes thought it not unfit, that to tlie principles,
which may be afligned to things, as the world is now conftituted, we fhould,
if we confidcr the great mafs of matter, as it was whilft the univerfe was in making,
add another, which may conveniently enough be called an architectonic principle or
power; by which 1 mean thole various determinations, and that fkilful guidance of
the motions of the fmall parts of the univcrfal matter by the moft wile author of
things, which were neceflary at the beginning to turn that confufed chaos into this
orderly and beautiful world ; and efpecially to contrive the bodies of animals and
plants, and the feeds of thole things, whole kinds were to be propagated. For I
confefs I cannot well conceive, how from matter, barely pot into motion, and t'lcn
left to itfelf, there could emerge fuch curious labncks, as the bodies of men a d
perfect animals, and fuch yet more admirably contrived parcels of nutccr, as the lccd3
of living creatures.
I sh"u j d likewife tell you upon what grounds, and in what fenfe, I fufpech'd the
principles of the world, as it now is, to be three, matter, motion and reft : I lay,
as the world now i^, becaufe the prefent fabric of the univerfe, and efpecially li.e
feeds of tilings together with tii- eftabUfhed courle of nature, is a requisite or condition,
upon whole Recount divers things v.. ay be in.ide out by our three principles,
which otherwife would be very hard, if poffibie, to explicate.

I shoold moreover declare in general (for I pretend not to be able to do it otherwife)
not only why I conceive tha* colours, odours, taftes, fluidnefs and folidify, and
thotc other qualities, that diverfiiy and denominate bodies, may intelligibly be deduced
from thefe three \ but how two of the three Epicurean principles (which, I
need not tell you, arc magnitude, figure, and weight) arc themfelves dcducible from
matter and motion •, fince the latter of thcle varioufly agitating, and, as it were, diftracting
the former, mull needs disjoin its parts •, which being actually feparated,
mult each of them ncceffarily both be of fome fize, and obtain lbmc lhape or other.
Nor did I add to our principles the Ariftotclian privation, partly for other realbns,
which 1 mult not now itay to infill on •, and partly, becaufe it feems to be rather an
anrecedent, or a terminus a quo, than a true principle, as the ftarting-poft is none of
the horfe's legs or limbs.
I should alfo explain, why and how I made reft to be, though not fo confiderable
a principle of things, as motion, yet a principle of them partly, becaufe it is (for
aught we know) as antient at leaft as it, and depends not upon motion, nor any other
quality of matta ; and partly, becaufe it may enable thr body, in which it happens
to be, both to continue in a Hate of reft, till lbmc external force put it out of that
ftate, and to concur to the productions of divers changes in the bodies, that hit
againft it, by either quite Hopping or leiTening their motion (whilft the body formerly
at reft receives all or part of it into itfclf) or elfe by giving a new biafs, of
lbmc other modification, to motion, that is, to the grand and primary inftrumenr,
whereby nature produces all the changes and other qualities, that are to be met with
in the world.
I should likewife, after all this, explain to you how, although matter, motion,
and reft, fecmed to me to be the catholic principles of the univerfe, I thought the
principles of particular bodies might be commodioufly enough reduced to two
namely matter, and (what comprehends the two other, and their effects) the refult*
or aggregate, or complex of thofe accidents, which arc the motion or reft (for in
fome bodies both arc not to be found) the bignefs, figure, texture, and the thence refill
ring qualities of the fmall parts, which are neceffary to entitle the body, whereto
they belong, to this or that peculiar denomination ; and difcriminating it from others,,
to appropriate it to a determinate kind of things (as yellownefs, fixednefs, fuch a
degree of weight, and of ductility, do make the portion of matter wherein they
concur, to be reckoned among perfect metals, and obtain the name of gold j) this
aggregate or rcfult of accidents you may, if you pleafe, call cither itructure, or
texture (though indeed that do not fo properly comprehend the motion of the conftituent
paits, cfpecially in cafe fome of them be fluid) or what other appellation
ihall appear tnoft expreffivc. Or if, retaining the vulgar term, you will call it the
form or the tlung it denominates, I fhall not much oppofc it •, provided the word

I want time to offer you what may be alleged to clear and countenance thefi: notions
my defign in mentioning them unto you at prefent being, partly, to bring fome light
and confirmation to divers paffages of my difcourie to you ; partly, to fhew you,
that I do not (as you feem to have fufpected) embrace all Epicurus\ principles, but
diflent from him in fome main things, as well as from Arijtotle and the chymilts, in
others and partly alfo, or rather chiefly, to intimate to you the grounds, upon which
I like wife difler from Htlmont in this, that whereas he afcribes almoft all things, and
even difeafes themfelves, to their determinate feeds, I am of opinion, that befidrs the
peculiar fabrics of the bodies of plants and animals (and perhaps alfo of fome meeds
and minerals) which I take to be effects of feminal principles, there are many other
bodies in nature, which have and deferve diftinct and proper names, but yet do but
refult from fuch contextures of the matter they arc made of, as may without determinate
feeds be effected by heat, cold, artificial mixtures and compofitions, and divers
other caufes, which fometimes nature imploys of her own accord, and oftentimes man
by his power and fkill makes ufe of, to fafhion the matter according to his'intentions.
This may be exemplified both in the productions of nature, and in thofe of art : of
the firft fort I might name multitudes ; but to fhew how flight a variation of textures,
without addition of new ingredients, may procure a parcel of matter divers names,
and make it be looked upon as different things j
I shall invite you to obferve with me, that clouds, rain, hail, fnow, froft, and
ice, may be but water, having its parts varied as to their fizc and diftancc in refpect
of each other, and as to motion and red. And among artificial productions we may
take notice (to fkip the cryftals of tartar) of glafs, regulus martis ftcllatus, and particularly
of the fugar of lead ; which, though made of that infipid metal and four
fait of vinegar, has in it a fweetnefs furpafling that of common fugar, and divers
other qualities, which being not to be found in either of its two ingredients, muft be
confefled to belong to the concrete itfelf, upon the account of its texture.
This confideration premifed, it will be, I hope, the more eafy to perfuade you,
that the fire may as well produce fome new textures in a parcel of matter, as deltroy
the old.
Wherefore hopin?, that you have not forgot the arguments formerly employed
againll the doctrine of the tria prima ; namely, that the fait, fulphur, and mercury,
into which the fire feems to refolve vegetable and animal bodies, are yet compounded^
not fimple and elementary l'ubftanccs ; and thrt (as appeared by the experiment of
pompions) the tria prima may be made out of water , hoping, I fay, that you remember
thefe, and the other things, that 1 formerly rcprcfented to the fame purpoJe,
I (hall now only add, that if we doubt not the truth of fome of Hchnc;;/'s relations,
we may well doubt, whether any of thefe heterogeneities be (I fay, not pre-ex fttnr,
fo as to convene together, when a plant or animal is to be conftitutcd, but) lb much
as in-exiltcnt in the concrete, whence they are obtained, when the chymiit iirft goes
about to relblve it. Kor, not to infiil upon the un-inflammable fpirit of fuch concretes,
becaufe that may be pretended to be but a mixture of phlegm and fait, the

it may be a production of the fire, which, by rranfporting and othcrwife altering the
partie'es of the matter, does bring it to a lalme nature.
For I know (fays he, in the place forme ly alleged to another purpofe) a way to
reduce all (tones into a mere fait of equal weight with the ftone, whence it was produced,
and that without any of the kail either fulphur or mercury ; which afleveration
of my author would perhaps (rem lefs incredible to you, if I uurft acqua nt you
with all 1 could fay upi.n that fubject. And hence by the way you may alio conclude,
that the f Iphur and mercury, as they call them, thit chymifts are wont to
obtain from compound bodies by the fire, may polfibly in many cafes be the productions
of it; fince if the fame bodies had been wrought upon by the agents employed
by Helmut, they would have yielded neither fulphur nor mercury -, and thofe portions
of them, which the fire would have prefented us in the form of fulphureous and
mercurial bodies, would have, by Ilclmonfs method, been exhibited to us in the form
of fait. .
But though (fays Eleutberius) you have alleged very plaufible arguments againft
the tria prima, yet I fee not how it will be poflible for you to avoid acknowledging,
that earth and water are elementary ingredients, thougli not of mineral concretes,
yet of all animal and vegetable bodies ; fince if any of thefe, of what fort foever,
be committed to diftillation, there is regularly and conftantly fcparated from it a
phlegm or aqueous part, and a taput mcrtuum or earth.
I readily acknowledge (anfwers Carneada) it is not fo eafy to reject, water and
earth (and efpecially the former) as it is to reject the tria prima, from being the elements
of mixt bodies; but it is not every difficult thing, that is impoflible.
I consider then, as to water, that the chief qualities, which make men give that
name to any vifible fubftance, are, that it is fluid or liquid, and that it is infipid and
inodorous. Now, as for the tafte of thefe qualities, I think you have never leen any
of thofe fcparated fubftances, that the chymifts call phlegm, which was perfectly devoid
both of tafte and fmell : and if you object, that yet it may be rcalbnably fuppofed,
that fince the whole body is liquid, the mafs is nothing but elementary water
faintly imbued with fome of the faline or fulphureous parts of the fame concrete,
which it retained with it upon its feparation from the other ingredients : to this I
anfwer, that this objection would not appear fo ftrong as it is plaufible, if chymifts
underftand the nature of fluidity and compactnefs ; and that, as I formerly obferved,
to a body's being fluid there is nothing neceflary, but that it be divided into parts
fmall enough •, and that thefe parts be put into fuch a motion among themfelves, as
to glide fome this way, and fome that way, along each other's furfaces. So that although
a concrete were never fo dry, and had not any water or other liquor in-exiftent
in it, yet fuch a comminution of its parts may be made, by the fire or other agents,
as to turn a great portion of them into liquor. Of this truth I will give an inftancc,.
employed by our friend here prcfent, as one of the moft conducive of his experiments
to illuftrate the nature of falts. If you take, then, fea-falt, and melt it in the fire,
to free it from the aqueous parts, and afterwards diftil it with a vehement fire from
burnt clay, or any other, as dry a caput mortuum as you pleafe, you will, as chymifts
confefs by teaching it, drive over a good part of the fait in the form of a liquor.
And to fatisfy fome ingenious men, that a great part of this liquor was ftill true feafalt,
brought by the operation of the fire into corpufcles fo fmall, and perhaps fo
advantageoufly ftiaped, as to be capable of the form of a fluid body, he did in my
prefence pour to fuch fpiritual falts a due proportion of the fpirit (or fait and phlegm)
of urine, whereby having evaporated the luperfluous moifturc, he loon obtained fuch
another
The Sceptical Chysist,
another concrete, both as to tafte and fmcll, and eafy fublimablenefs, as common
(alt armoniae, which you know is made up of grols and undiftillcd fca-falt, united
with the falts of urine and of foot, which too arc very near of kin to each otlier.
And further, to manifeft, that the corpufcles of fea-falt and the faline ones of the
urine retain their feveral natures in this concrete, he mixt it with a convenient quantity
of fait of tartar, and committing it to diftillation, foon regained his fpirit of urine
in a liquid form by itfelf, the fea-falt ftaying behind with the Lit of tartar. Wherefore
it is very pofliblc, that dry bodies may by the fire be reduced to liquors without
any fcparation of elements, but barely by a certain kind of diffipatioH and comminution
of the matter, whereby its parts are brought into a new ftate. And if it be
(till objected, that the phlegm of mixt bodies mult be reputed water, becaulc fo weak
a tafte needs but a very fmall proportion of fait to impart it ; it may be replied,
that, for aught appears, common fait and divers other bodies, though they be diftilled
never lb dry, and in never fo clole veficls, will yield each of them pretty ftorc
of a liquor, wherein though (as I lately noted) faline corpufcles abound, yet there
is bcfidcs a large proportion of phlegm, as may eafdy be dilcovered by coagulating
the faline corpufcles with any convenient body ; as I lately told you, our friend coagulated
part of the fpirit of fait with fpirit of urine ; and as I have divers times
Separated a fait from oil of vitriol itfelf (though a very ponderous liquor, and drawn
from a faline body) by boiling it with a juft quantity of mercury, and then wafhing
the newly coagulated fait from the precipitate with fair water. Now to what can we
more probably afcribe this plenty of" aqueous fubftance afforded us by the diftillation
of fuch bodies, than unto this, that among the various operations of the fire upon
the matter of a concrete, divers particles or that matter are reduced to fuch a ftiape
and bignefs, as is rcquifite to compofc fuch a liquor, as chymifts are wont to call
phlegm or water ? How 1 conjecture this change may be effected, it is neither necefiary
for me to tell you, nor poflible to do fo without a much longer difcourfe than
were now feafonable. But 1 defire you would, with me, reflect upon what I formerly
told you, concerning the change of quickfilver into water; for that water having
but a very faint tafte, if any whit more than divers of thofe liquors, that chymifts
refer to phlegm, by that experiment it feems evident, that even a metalline body,
and therefore much more fuch as are but vegetabl.- or animal, may by a funple operation
of the fire be turned in great part into water. And fince thole I dilpute with
are not yet able out of gold, or filver, or divers other concretes, to feparate any thing
like water ; 1 hope I may be allowed to conclude againft them, that water itfelf is not
an univerfal and prc-exiftent ingredient of mixt bodies.
But as for thofe chymifts, that, luppofin.; with me the truth of what Helmont relates
of the alkaheft's wonderful effects, have a right to prels me with his authority
concerning them, and to allege, that he could tranfmutc all reputed mixt bodies into
infipid and mere water-, to thofe I (hall rcprefent, that though his affirmations conclude
ftrongly againft the vulgar chymifts (againft whom I have not therefore fcrupled
to employ them) fince they evince, that the commonly reputed principles or ingredients
of things are not permanent and indeftrucYible, fince diey may be further reduced
into infipid phlegm differing from them all ; yet till we can be allowed to
examine this liquor, I think it not unreafonable to doubt whether it be not fomething
elfc than mere water. For I find not any other realbn given by Helmont of his pronouncing
it fo, than that it is infipid. Now fapour being an accident or an affection
of matter, that relates to our tongue, palate, and other organs of tafte, it may very
poflibly be, that the fmall pans of a body may be of fuch a fize and fliapc, as cither

by their extreme littlencfs, or by their flendernefs, or by their figure, to be unable
to pierce into and make perceptible impreffion-upon the nerves or membranous parts
of the organs of taftc, and yet may be fit to work otherwife upon divers other
bodies than mere water can, and conlequently to difclofe itfelf to be of a nature far
enough from elementary. In filk dyed red or of any other colour, whilft many contiguous
threads make up a fkein, the colour of the filk is confpicuous ; but if only a
very few of them be looked upon, the colour will appear much fainter than before.
But if you take out one fimple thread, you (hall not eafily be able to difcern any
colour at all , fo fubtile an object having not the force to make upon the optic nerve
an impreflion great enough to be taken notice of. It is alfo obferved, that the beft
fort of oil olive is almoft taftelefs j and yet I need not tell you how exceedingly diftant
in nature oil is from water. The liquor, into which I told you, upon the relation
of Lully an eye-witnefs, that mercury might be tranfmutcd, has fometimes but a
very languid, if any tafle ; and yet its operations, even upon fome mineral bodies,
are very peculiar. Quickfilvcr itfelf alfo, though the corpufcles it confifts of be fo
very fmall, as to get into the pores of that clofeft and compacted of bodies, gold, is
yet (you know) altogether taltelefs. And our Helmont feveral times tells us, that fair
water, wherein a little quantity of quickfilver has lain for fome time, though it acquire
no certain taftc or other fenfible quality from the quickfilver yet it has a power
to deftroy worms in human bodies •, which he does much, but not caulelefsly extol.
And 1 remember, a great lady, that had been eminent for her beauty in divers courts,
confeficd to me, that this infipid liquor was of all innocent wafties for the face the beft,
that flic ever met with.
And here let me conclude my difcourfe, concerning fuch waters or liquors as I
hive hitherto been examining, with thefe two confiderations. Whereof the firft is, that
by rcalbn of our being wont to drink nothing but wine, beer, cyder, or other ftrongly
tailed liquors, there may be in feveral of thofe liquors, that are wont to pafs for mlipid
phlegm, very peculiar and diftintt tallcs, though unheeded (and perhaps not
to be perceived) by us. For to omit what naturalifts affirm of apes (and which probably
may be true of divers other animals) that they have a more exquifite palate
than men among men themfelves, thole, that are wont to drink nothing but water,
may (as I have tried in myfclf) dilccrn very fenfibly a gre;it difference of taftes in feveral
water?, which one unaccuftomed to drink water would take to be all alike infipid.
And this is the firft of my two confiderations. The other is, that it is not
impoflible, that the corpufcles, into which a body is diflipated by the fire, may by
the operation of the fame fire have their figures fo altered, or may be by alfociations
with one another brought into little mafles of fuch a fize and (hapc, as not to be fit
to make fenfible impreliions on the tongue. And that you may not think fuch alterations
iinpoffible, be pleafcd to confidcr with me, that not on'y the fharpeft fpirit of
vinegar having diflblved as much coral as ic can, will coagulate with it into a fubftance,
which, though fohlblc in water like fait, is incomparably left ftrongly tailed
than the vinegar was before ; but (what is more confidcrablc) though the acid falts,
that arc carried up with quickfilver, in the preparation of common Uiblimate, are fo
lharp, that beinp moillcncd with water it will corrode fome of the metals themfelves-,
yet this corrofive fublimate being twic or thrice re-fublimed with a full proportion of
infipid quickfilvcr, conltitutes "(as you know) that factitious concrete, which the
chymilb call mercurius dulds ; not becaufc it is fwect, but becaule the fharpnefs of
the corrofive falts is fo taken away by their combination with the mercurial corpufcles,
that the whole mixture, when k is prepared, is judged to be infipid.

Akd thus (continues Carneades) haying given you fome reafons, why I rcfufe to
admit elementary water for a conftant ingredient of mixt bodies, it will be eafy for
me to give you an account, why I alio reject earth.
For firft, it may well be lulpecled, that many fubftances pals among chymifts
under the name of earth, becauic, like it, they are dry, and heavy, and lixt ; which
yet are very far from an elementary nature. This you will not think improbable,
if you recall to mind what I formerly told you concerning what chymifts call
the dead earth of things, and efpcciaUy touching the copper to be drawn from the
'
caput mcrtuutn of vitriol ; and if alio you allow me to fubjoin a cafual, but memorable
experiment, made by Jshanrui Agricela upon the terra dam/iata of brimftone.
Our author then tells us (in his notes upon Popius) that in the year 162 1 he made an
oil of fulphur ; the remaining faeces he reverberated in a moderate fire fourteen days ;
afterwarus he put them well luted up in a wind oven, and gave them a ftrong fire for
fix hours, purpofing to calcine the feces to a perfect whitenefs, that he might make
fomethir.g elfe out of them. But coming to break the pot, he found above but very
litde farces, and thole grey and not white -, but beneath there lay a fine red regulus,
which ho rirft marvelled at, and knew not what to make of, being well allured, that
not the lea;t thing, befides the farces of the fulphur, came ipto the pot ; and that the
fulphur itfclf had only been duTolved in unlced-oil. This regulus he found heavy
and malleable almoft as lead •, having caufed a goldfmith to draw him a wire of it,
he found it to be of the faireft copper, and fo rightly coloured, that a Jew of Prague
offered him a great price for it. And of this metal he fays he had twelve loth (or lix
ounces) out of one pound of alhes or faeces. And this ftory may well incline us to
AifpccT;, that fince the caput nwrtuum of the fulphur was kept fo long in the fire, before
it was found to be any thing elfe than a terra damnatat there may be divers other
rcfidences of bodies, which are wont to pafs only for the terreltrial fxxes of things
and therefore to be thrown away, as foon as the diftillation or calcination of the body
that yielded them is ended ; which yet, if they were long and fkilfully examined
by the fire, would appear to be differing from elementary earth. And I have taken
notice of the unwarrantable forwardnels of common chymifts to pronounce things
ufelefs feces, by obfervin~ how often they reject the caput morluum of verdigrcafc j
which is yet fo far from deferving that name, that not only by ftrong fires, and convenient
additamcnts, it may in fome hours be reduced into copper, but with a certain
flux powder I (bmetimes make for recreation, I have in two or three minutes obtained
that metal from it. To which I may add, that having for trial's fake kept Venetian
talc in no lefs a heat than that of a glais-furnace, I found, after all the brurit of the
fire it had indured, the remaining body, though brittle and difcoloured, had not loft
very much of its former bulk, and feemcd ftill to be nearer of kin to talc, than to
mcer earth. And I remember too, that a candid mincralift, famous for his. Ikill in
trying of ores, requeuing me one day to procure him a certain American mineral
earth of a virtuofo, who, he thought, would not rcfufe me ; I inquired of him, why
he feemed fo greedy of it : he confefied to me, that this gentleman having brought
that earth to the public fay-mafters; and upon their being unable by any means to
bring it to fufion, or make it fly away, he (the relator) had procured a little of it
;
and having tried it with a peculiar flux, feparated from it near a third part of pure
gold i fo great miftak« may be committed in hafti'y concluding things to be uiclefs
earth.
NtxT, it may be fuppofed, that as in the refolution of bodies by the fire, fome of
the diflipated parts may, by their various occurfion occafioned by the heat, be brought

to (lick together fo clofely, as to conftitute corpufcles too heavy for the fire to carry
away ; the aggregate of which corpufcles is wont to be called aflies of earth j fo other
agents may rcfolvc the concrete into minute parts after fo differing a manner, as not
to produce any caput morluum, or dry and heavy body. As you may remember
Htlmont above informed us, that with his great diffolvcnt he divided a coal into
two liquid and volatile bodies equiponderant to the coal, without any dry or fixt refidence
at all.
And indeed, I fee not, why it mould be neccflary, that all agents, that refolve
bodies into portions of differing qualified matter, mull work on them the fame way,
and divide them into juft fuch parts, both for nature and number, as the fire difli pates
them into. For fince (as I noted before) the bulk and fhapc of the fmall parts of
bodies, together with their fitnels and unfitnefs to be eafily put into motion, may
make die liquors, or other fubftanccs fuch corpufcles compofe, as much to differ
from each other, as do fome of the chymical principles : why may not l'omething
happen in this cafe, not unlike what is ufual in the grofTer divifions of bodies by
mechanical inftruments ? where we fee, that fome tools reduce wood, for inftance,
into parts of fevcral (hapes, bignefs, and other qualities, as hatchets and wedges
divide it into groffer parts j fome more long and (lender, as fplinters j and fome
more thick and irregular, as chips , but all of confiderable bulk : but files and faws
make a comminution of it into duft j which, as all the others, is of the more folid
fort of parts whereas others divide it into long and broad, but thin and flexible
parts, as do planes. And of this kind of parts itfclf there is alfo a variety, according
to the difference of the tools employed to work on the wood ; the (havings made
by the plane being in fome things differing from thofc (hives or thin and flexible pieces
of wood, that are obtained by borers, and thefe from fome others obtainable by
other tools. Some chymical examples applicable to this purpofe I have clfewhere
given you. To which I may add, that whereas, in a mixture of fulphur and fait of
tartar well melted and incorporated together, the action of pure fpirit of wine digefted
on it is to feparate the fulphureous from the alcalizate parts, by diflblving the
former, and leaving the latter, the action of wine (probably upon the fcore of its
copious phlegm) upon the fame mixture, is to divide it into corpufcles confiding of
both alcalizate and fulphureous parts united. And if it be objected, that this is but
a factitious concrete ; I anfwer, that however the inftance may fcrvc to illuftrate what
I propofed, if not to prove it and that nature herfelf doth in the bowels of the
earth make decompounded bodies, as we fee in vitriol, cinnabar, and even in fulphur
itfclf-, I will not urge, that the fire divides new milk into five differing fubftanccs
;
but rennet and acid liquors divide it into a coagulated matter and a thin whey: and
on the other fide, churning divides it into butter and butter-milk, which may either
of them yet be reduced to other fubftances differing from the former. I will not prefs
this, I lay, nor other mftances of this nature, becaufe I cannot in few words anfwer
what may be objected, that thefe concretes fequcftered without the help of the fire
may by it be further divided into hypoftatical principles. But I will rather reprefent,
that whereas the fame fpirit of wine will diffociate the parts of camphire, and make
them one liquor wkh itielfj aqua fortis will alfo disjoin them, and put them into motion
-, but fo as to keep them together, and yet alter their texture into the form of an
oil. I know alfo an uncompounded liquor, that an extraordinary chymilt would not
Allow to be fo much as faline, which doth (as I have tried) from coral itfclf (as fixt
as divers judicious writers aflert that concrete to be) not only obtain a noble tincture,
without the intervention of nitre or other falts, but will carry over the tincture in
diftUlauon.

diftillation. And if fomc rcafons did not forbid mc, I could now tell you of a menftruum
I make myfelf, that doth more oddly difibciate the parts of minerals very fixe
in the fire. So that it feems not incredible, that there may be fomc agent or way of
operation found, whereby this or that concrete, if not all firm bodies, may be icfolvcd
into parts fo very minute and fo apt to ftick dole to one another, that none of
them may be fixt enough to ftay belund in a ftrong fire, and to be incapable of diftillation
; nor confequently to be looked upon as earth. But to return to ffelmmt,
the fame author fomewhere fupplies me with another argument againft the earth's
being iuch an element, as my adverfarics would have it. For he fomewhere affirms,
that he can reduce all the tcrreftrial parts of mixt bodies into infipid water •, whence
we may argue againft the earth's being one of their elements, even from that notion
of elements, which you may remember Pbiloponus recited out of Arijiotle himfelf,
when he lately difputcd for his chymifts againft Tbemifiius. And here we may on this
occafion confider, that fince a body, from which the fire hath driven away its loofer
parts, is wont to be looked upon as earth, upon the account of its being endowed
with both thefe qualities, taftlefsnefs and fixednefs (for fait of tartar, though fixed,
pafles not among the chymifts for earth, becaufc it is ftrongly tailed) if it be in the
power of natural agents to deprive the caput mortuum of a body of cither of thofe
two qualities, or to give them both to a portion of matter, that had them not both
be/ore, the chymifts will not eafily define what part of a refolved concrete is earth,
and make out, that that earth is a primary, fimplc, and indcftruflable body. Now
there are fome cafes, wherein the more fkilful or the vulgar chymifts themfelvcs pretend
to be able, by repeated cohobations, and other fit operations, to make the
diftilled parts of a concrete bring itjs own caput mortuum over the helm, in the form
of a liquor ; in which ftatc being both fluid and volatile ; you will eaiily believe it
would not be taken for earth. And indeed by a fkilful, but not vulgar, way of -
managing fomc concretes, there may be more cffe&ed in this kind, than you perhaps
would cafily think. And on the other fide, diat either earth may be generated, or
at leaft bodies, that did not before appear to be near totally earth, may be fo altered
as to pafs for it, feems very poffible, if * Helmont have done that by art, which hementions
in fcvcral places ; efpecially where he fays, that he knows ways, whereby
fulphur once diflblved is all of it fixed into a terreftrial powder, and the whole body
of falt-petre may be turned into earth : which laft he elfewhcre fays is done by the
odour only of a certain fulphureous fire. And in another place he mentions one way
of doing this, which I cannot give you an account of-, becaufc the materials I had
prepared for trying it, were by a fervant's miftakc unhappily thrown away.
And, thefe laft arguments may bs confirmed by the experiment I have often had
occafion to mention, concerning the mint I produced out of water. And partly by
an oblcrvation of Rondcletius concerning the growth of animals alfo, nourifhed but by
water, which I remembered not to mention, when I difcourfed to you about the production
of things out of water. This diligent writer then, in fits inftructive book of \x» ,,

glafs icfelf, though that were of a large capacity. And bccaull- there is no juft reaforf
to doubt, that this fifti, if diftillcd, would have yielded the like differing fubftances
with other animals ; and however, becaufe the mint, which I had out oi water, afforded
mc upon di(t illation a good quantity of charcoal , I think I may from thence
infer, that earth itfelf may be produced out of water \ or if you pleafe, that water
may be tranfinuted into earth : and confequently, that though it could be proved,
that earth is an ingredient actually in-exiftent in the vegetable and animal bodies,
whence it may be obtained by fire ; yet it would not neceflarily follow, that earth,
as a pre-exiftcntt clement, does with other principles convene to make up thofe bodies,
whence it feems to have been leparated.
After all is faid (fays Eltutbtriw) I have yet fomething to object, that I cannot
but think confidcrablc, fince Carneades himfelf alleged it as fuchj for, (continues
EUutberius fmiling) I muft make bold to try, whether you can as luckily anfwer your
own arguments, as thofe of your antagonifts ; I mean (purfues he) that part of your
conceflions, wherein you cannot but remember, that you fupplied your adveriaries
with an example to prove, that there may be elementary bodies, by taking notice,
that gold may be an ingredient in a multitude of differing mixtures, and yet retain its
nature, notwithftanding all that the chymifts by their fires and corrofive waters areable
to do to deftroy it.
I sufficiently intimated to you at that time (replies Carneades) that I propofed
this example, chiefly to (hew you, how nature may be conceived to have made elements,
not to prove, that lhe actually has made any ; and you know, that a pojfe ad
tjfe the inference will not hold. But (continues Cameades) to anfwer more directly
to the objection drawn from gold, I muft tell you, that though I know very well,
that divers of the more fbbcr chymifts have complained of the vulgar chymifts, as of*
mountebanks or cheats, for pretending fo vainly, as hitherto they have done, to deftroy
gold i yet I know a certain menftruum (which our friend has made, and intends
(hortly to communicate to the ingenious) of fo piercing and powerful a quality ; that
if notwithftanding much care, and fome (kill, I did not much deceive myfelf, I have
with it really deftroyed even refined gold, and brought it into a metalline body of
another colour and nature, as I found by trials purpofely made. And if fome juft
confidcrations did not for the prefent forbid it, I could perchance here (hew you by
another experiment or two of my own trying, that fuch menftruums may be made,
as to entice away and retain divers parts from bodies, which even the more judicious
and experienced Spagyrifts have pronounced irrefolublc by the fire ; though (which
I defire you would mark) in neither of thefe inftances, the gold or precious ftones be
analyfed into any of the tria prima, but only reduced to new concretes. And indeed
there is a great difparicy betwixt the operations of the feveral agents, whereby the
parts of a body come to be diffipated. As if (for inftance) you difiolve the purer
fort of vitriol in common water, the liquor will fwallow up the mineral, and fo diflbciate
its corpufclcs, that they will fcem to make up but one liquor with thofe of the
water ; and yec each of thefe corpufclcs retains its nature and texture, and remains a
vitnolate and compounded body. But if the lame vitriol be expofed to a ftrong fire,
it will then be divided, not only, as before, into fmaller parts, but into heterogeneous
fubftances, each of the vitriolate corpufcles, that remained entire in the water*
b^ing itfelf upon the deftruction of its former texture difiipatcd or divided into new
particles of differing qualities. But inftances more fidy applicable to thispurpofe I
have already given you. Wherefore to return to what I told you about the deftructiou

either faune, or fulphureous, or tcrreftrial portions of matter, whofc parts were lb
Tmall, fo firmly united together, or of a figure fo fit to make them cohere to one another
(as we fee, that in quickfilvcr, broken into little globes, the parts brought to
touch one another do immediately re-imbody) that neither the fire, nor the ufual
agents, employed by chymifts, are piercing enough to divide their parts, fo as to deft
roy the texture of the fingle corpufcles j yet it would not neceflarily follow, that
fuch permanent bodies were elementaty ; fince it is poffible, there may be agents
found in nature, fome of whofc parts may be of fuch a fize and figure, as to take
better hold of fome parts of thefe feemingly elementary corpufcles, than thefe parts
do of the reft ; and confequently may carry away fuch parts with xhem, and fo diffolve
the texture of the corpufcle by pulling its parts afunder. And if it be faid,
that at leaft wc may this way difcover the elementary ingredients of things, by obferving
into what fubftances thefe corpufcles, that were reputed pure, are divided ; I
anfwer, that it is not necefiary, that fuch a difcovery ftiould be practicable. For if
the particles of the difiolvent do take fuch firm hold of thofe of the diflblved body,
they muft conftitute together new bodies, as well as deftroy the old ; and the ftri'ct
union, which, according to this hypothefis, may well be l'uppofed betwixt the parts
of the emergent bodies will make it as little to be expected, that they ftiould be
pulled afunder, but by little parts of matter, that to divide them, aflbciate themfelves,
and ftick extremely clofe to thofe of them, which they fever from their former
adherents. Befides that it is not impoftible, that a corpufcle, fuppofed to be elementary,
may have its nature changed, without fuffering a divorce of its parts, barely
by a new texture effected by fome powerful agent ; as I formerly told you, the lame
portion of matter may eafily, by the operation of the fire, be turned at pleafure into
the form of a brittle and tranfparenr, or an opacous and malleable body.
And indeed, if you confider how far the bare change of texture, whether made
by art or nature (or rather by nature with or without the afliftancc of man) can g}
in producing fuch new qualities in the fame parcel of matter, and how many inanimate
bodies (fuch as are all the chymical productions of the fire) wc know are denominated
and diftinguifhed, not fo much by any imaginary fubftantial form, as by
the aggregate of thefe qualities •, if you confider thefe things, I fay, and that the
varying ot either figure, or the fize, or the motion, or the firuation, or connexion
of the corpufcles whereof any of thefe bodies is compofed, may Alter the fabric of
it, you will poffibly be invited to fufpect with me, that there is no great need, that
nature ftiould always have elements before-hand, whereof to make fuch bodies as
we call mixts. And that it is not fo eafy as chymifts and others have hitherto imagined,
to dtfeern, among the many differing fubftances, that may without any i .'-
traordinary fkill be obtained from the fame portion of matter, which ought to bs
efteemed, cxclufivcly to all the reft, its in-exiltent elementary ingredients, much left
to determine, what primogeneal and fimple bodies convened together to compofe it.
To exemplify this, I fliall add, to what I have already on feveral occafions reprelented,
but this hngle inftancc :
You may remember (Eleutberius) that I formerly intimated to you, that befides
mint and pompions, I produced divers other vegetables of very differing natures out
of water. Wherefore you will not, I prefume, think it incongruous to fuppofe, that
when a flcnder vine-flip is fet into the ground, and takes root there, it may likewile
receive its nutriment from the water attracted out of the earth by its roots, or impcll-

ed by the warmth of the fun, or preflure of the ambient air into the pores of them.
And this you will the more eafily believe, if you ever obferved, what a ftrange quantity
of water will drop out of a wound given to the vine, in a convenient place, at a
feafonablc time in the fpring •, and how little of tafte or fmell this aqua vitae, as phyficians
call it, is endowed with, notwithftanding what concoction or alteration it may
receive in its paffage through the vine, to difenminate it from common water. Suppoling
then this liquor, at its firft entrance into the roots of the vine, to be common
water ; let us a little confider, how many various fubftances may be obtained from
it ; though, to do fo, I mult repeat fomcwhat, that I had a former occafion to touch
upon. And firft, this liquor being digefted in the plant, and afiimilated by the feveral
parts of it, is turned into the wood, bark, pith, leaves, &c. of the vine ; the fame
liquor may be further dried, and falhioncd into vine-buds, and thefe a while after are
advanced unto four grapes, which exprefTed yield verjuice, a liquor very differing
in feveral qualities both from wine and other liquors obtainable from the vine : thefe
four grapes, being by the heat of the fun concocted and ripened, turn to well tafted
grapes ; thefe, it dried in the fun and diftilled, afford a foetid oil and a piercing cmpyrcumatical
fpirit, but not a vinous fpirit ; thefe dried grapes or raifins, boiled in a
convenient proportion of water, make a fweet liquor, which, being betimes diftilled,
afford an oil and fpirit much like thofe of the raifins themfclves ; if the juice of the
grapes be Iqueezed out, and put to ferment, it firft becomes a fweet and turbid liquor,
then grows lefs fweet and more clear, and then affords in common diftillations not an
oil, but a fpirit, which, though inflammable like oil, differs much from it, in that it
is not fat, and that it will readily mingle with water. I have likewife without addition
obtained in procefs of time (and by an eafy way, which I am ready to teach you)
from one of the nubleft forts of wine, pretty ftorc of pure and curioufly figured
cryftals of fait, together with a great proportion of a liquor as fwcct almoft as honey;
and thefe I obtained not from muft, but true and fprightly wine; befides the vinous
liquor, the fermented juice of grapes is parcly turned into liquid drops or lees, and
partly into that cruft or dry feculencv, that is commonly called tartar; and this tartar
may by the fire be eafily divided into five dificring fubftances ; four of which are not
acid, and the other not fo man'feftly acid as the tartar itft lf. The fame vinous juice
after fome time, tfpecially if it be carefully kept, degenerates into that very four
liquor called vinegar ; from which you may obtain by the fire a fpirit and a cryftalline
fair, diflering enough from the fpirit and lixiviate fait of tartar. And if you pour
the dcphlegmed fpirit of the vinegar upon the (alt of tartar, there will be produced
Inch a conflict or ebullition, as if there were fcarce two more contrary bodies in nature
•, and oftentimes in this vinegar you may obferve part of the matter to be turn.d
into an innumerable company of fwimming animals; which our friend having divers
years ago obferved, hath in one of his papers taught us, how to difcover clearly
without the help of a microfcope.

the roots of the vine, be brought ; partly by the formative power of the plant, and
partly by fupervenient agents or caufes, without the vifible concurrence of any extraneous
ingredi.nt. But if we be allowed to add to the productions of this tranfnuued
water a lew oilier fubft nces, we rr ay much increafe the variety of fuch bodies ; although
in this fecond fore of productions, the vinous parts teem fcarce to retain any

by their mixture with them, acquired fuch a difpofition, that in their recefc, occafioned
by the fire, they came to be altered as to ftiape, or bigncfs, or both, and affociatcd
after a new manner. Thus, as I formerly told you, I did, by the addition of
a caput mcrtuum of antimony, and fome other bodies unfit for diftillation, obtain
from crude tartar (tore of a very volatile and cryftalline fait, differing very much in
fmell and other qualities from the ufual falts of tartar.
But (fays Eleutberius) interrupting him at thefe words) if you have no reftraint
upon you, I would very gladly, before you go any further, be more particularly informed,
how you make this volatile fait , becaufe, you know, that fuch multitudes
of chymifts have, by a fcarce imaginable variety of ways, attempted in vain the
volatilization of the fait of tartar, that divers learned Spagyrifts fpeak, as if it were
impoflible to make any thing out of tartar, that mall be volatile in a falinc form,
or, as fome of them exprefs it, in forma ficca. I am very far from thinking
(anfwers Cameades) that the fait I have mentioned is that, which Paracelfus and-
Helmont mean, when they fpeak of fal tartari volatile, and afcribe fuch great things
to it. For the fait I fpeak of falls extremely Ihort of thofe virtues, not feeming
in its tafte, fmell, and other obvious qualities, to differ very much (though tomething
it does differ) from fait of hartlhorn, and other volatile falts drawn from the
diftilled parts of animals. Nor have I yet made trials enough to be fure, that
it is a pure fait of tartar, without participating any tiling at all of the nitre, or
antimony. But becaufe it fcems more likely to proceed from the tartar, than
from any of the other ingredients, and becaufe the experiment is in itfelf not ignoble,
and ludicrous enough (as (hewing a new way to produce a volatile fait,
contrary to acid falts, from bodies, that otherwife are obferved to yield no fuch liquor,
but either only, or chiefly acid ones ;) I (hall, to fatisfy you, acquaint you,
before any of my other friends, with the way 1 now uli (for I have formerly ufed fome
others) to make it.
Take then, of good antimony, falt-petrc, and tartar, of each an equal weight,
and of quick-lime half the weight of any one of them ; let thefe be powdered and
well mingled. This done, you muft have in readinefs a long neck or retort of
earth, which muft be placed in a furnace for a naked fire, and have at the top of
it a hole of a convenient bignefs, at which you may caft in the mixture, and
prefcntly ftop it up ag;.in. This veffel being fitted with a large receiver, mull
have fire made under it, till the bottom of the fides be red hot, and then you muft
caft in the above prepared mixture, by about half a fpoonful (more or lefs) at a
time, at the hole made for that purpofe ; which being nimbly ftopr, the fumes will
pal's into the receiver, and condenfe there into a liquor, that being reclined will
be of a pure golden colour, and carry up that colour to a great height. This
fpirit abounds in the fait I told you of, part of which may eafily enough be fcparated
by the way I ule in fuch edes, which is, to put the liquor into a glafs egg, or
bolt head with a long and narrow neck. For it this be placed a little inclining in
hot land, there will fublime up a fine fait, which, as I told you, I find to be
much of kin to the volatile files of animals : for like them it has a faltilh, not an
acid Lilt ; it hilf s upon the affulion of fpiric of nitre, or oil of vitriol j it precipitates

to try •, but I am apt to think they will not be defpicable. And befides that, a
very ingenious friend of mine tells mc, he hath done great matters againft the Hone
with a preparation not very much differing from ours ; a very experienced German
chymift rinding, that I was unacquainted with the ways of making this fait, told me,
that in a great city in his country, a noted chymift prizes it fo highly, that he had a
while fincc procured a privilege from the magiftrates, that none but he, or by his
licence, mould vend a Ipirit made-almoft after the fame way with mine, lave that he
leaves out one of the ingredients, namely the quick-lime. But (continues Carntades)
to refume my former dilcourfe, where your curiofity interrupted it
It is alfo a common practice in France to bury thin plates of copper in the marc
(as the French call it) or huflcs of grapes, whence the juice hath been fqueezed out
in the vine prefs j and by this means the more faline parts of thofe hulks, working
by little and little upon the copper, coagulate themfelves with it into that blucifh green
fubftance we in Englilh call vtrdigreale. Of which I therefore take notice, becaufe
having diftillcd it in a naked fire, I found, as I expected, that by the affociation of
the faline with the metalline parts, the former were fo altered, that the diftilled liquor,
even without rectification, fecmed by fmell and tafte, ftrong almoft like aqua
fortis, and very much furpaflfed the pureft and moft rectified fpirit of vinegar, that
, ever I made. And this {pint I therefore afcribe to the fait of the hulks altered by
their co-mixture with the copper (though the fire afterwards divorce and tranfmute
them) becaufe I found this latter in the bottom of the retort in the form of a crocus
or reddifti powder j and becaufe copper is of too fluggilh a nature to be forced over
in clofe veflels by no ftronger a heat. And that, which is alfo fomewhat remarkable
in the diftillation of good vcrdigrcafe (or at leaft of that fort that I ufed) is this, that
I never could obfervc, that it yielded me any oil (unlefs a little black (lime, which was
feparated in rectification may pafs for oil) though both tartar and vinegar (efpecially
the former) will by diftillation yield a moderate proportion of it. It likewife you
pour Ipirit of vinegar upon calcined lead, the acid fait of the liquor will by its commixture
with the metalline parts, though infipid, acquire in few hours a more than
ficcharine fwcetnefs •, and thefe faline parts being by a ftrong fire diftilled from the
lead, wherewith they were imbodied, will, as I formerly alfo noted to a different purpofe,
leave the metal behind them altered in fomc qualities from what it was, and
will themfelves afcend, partly in the form of an unctuous body or oil, partly in that
of phlegm, but for the greatcft part in the form of a fubtile fpirit, indowed, befides
divers new qualities, which I am not now willing to take notice of, with a ftrong
fmell very much other than that of vinegar, and a piercing tafte quite differing both
from the fournefs of the fpirit of vinegar, and the fweetneis of the fugar of lead.
To be fliort, as the difference of bodies may depend meerly upon that of the
fc hemes, whereinto their common matter is put; fothc feeds of things, the fire and
the other agents are able to alter the minute parts of a body (either by breaking them
into fmaller ones of differing (hapes, or by uniting together thefe fragments with the
unbroken corpufcles, or -filch corpufcles among themfclvcs) and the fame agents,
partly by altering the fhape or bignefsof the conftituent corpufcles of a body, partly
by driving away fume of them, partly by blending others with them, and partly by
fume new manner of connecting them, may give the whole portion of matter a new
-C-*xturc of its minute parts, and thereby make k defcrve a new and diftinct name.

wpon each other, or are connected together after this or that determinate manner, a
body of this or that denomination is produced, as fome other body happens thereby
to be altered or deftroyed.
Since then thofc things, which chymifts produce by the help of the fire, are but
inanimate bodies j fincc iuch fruits of the chymifts fldll differ from one another but in
lb few qualities, that we fee plainly, that by fire, and other agents we can employ,
we can eafily enough work as great alterations upon matter, as thofe, that are requifite
to change one of thefe chymical productions into another ; fince the fame portion
of matter may, without being compounded with any extraneous body, or at leaft
element, be made to put on fuch a variety of forms, and confequently to be (fucceffively)
turned into fo many differing bodies ; and fince the matter, cloathed with fo
many differing forms, was originally but water, and that in its paffage through lb
many transformations, it was never reduced into any of thofe fubftances, which arc
reputed to be the principles or elements of mixt bodies, except the violence of the
fire, which itfelf divides not bodies into perfectly fimple or elementary fubftances,
but into new compounds-, fince, I fay, thefe things are fo, I fee not, why we mult
needs believe, that there arc any primogencal and fimple bodies, of which, as of
pre-exiftent elements, nature is obliged to compound all others. Nor do I fee, why
we may not conceive, that fhe may produce the bodies accounted mixt out of one
another, by varioufly altering and contriving their minute parts, without refolving
the matter into any fuch fimple or homogeneous fubftances, as are pretended. Neither,
to difpatch, do I fee, why it ftiould be counted abfurd to think, that when a body is
refolvcd by the fire into its fuppofed fimple ingredients, thofe fubftances, are not true
and proper elements, but rather were, as it were, accidentally produced by the fire,
which by diffipating a body into minute parts does, if thofe parts be fhut up in
clofe veflels, for the moil part neccflarily bring them to afibciate themfelves after another
manner than before, and fo bring them into bodies of fuch different confluences,
as the former texture of the body and concurrent circumftances make fuch
difbanded particles apt to conftitute as experience Ihews us (and 1 have both noted
it, and proved it already) that as there are fome concretes whofc parts, when diffipatcd

not in the fire yield bodies of the like confiftencies, but rather others of differing
textures-, not to mention, that from gold and fome other bodies, we fee not, that the
fire feparates any diftinct fubftances at all-, nor that even thofe fimilar parts of

bear, but compound bodies, upon which, for their refemblancc to them in confiftence,

The Conclusion.
XHE S E laft words of Carneades being foon after followed by a noifc, which
fecmed to come from the place, where the reft of the company was, he took
a warning, that it was time for him to conclude or break off his difcourfe ; and
told his friend, by this time, I hope, you fee, Eleutberius, that if f/elmont's experiments
be true, it is no abfurdity to queftion, whether that doctrine be one, that doth
not aflert any elements in the fenfe before explained. But becaufe that as divers of
my arguments fuppofe the marvellous power of the alkaheit in the analyzing of
bodies, fo the effects aicribed to that power are fo unparallcllcd and ftupendous, that
though I am not furc, but that there may be fuch an agent, yet little lefs than mon^Ut
feems requifite to make a man fure there is. And coniequently I leave it you to judge,
how far thofe of my arguments, that are built upon alkaheftical operations, are
weakened by that liquor's being matchlefs •, and mall therefore defire you not to
think, that 1 propofc this paradox, that rejects all elements, as an opinion equally
probable with the former part of my difcourfe. For by that, I hope, you arc fatisfied,
that the arguments, wont to be brought by chvtnifts to prove, that all bodies
confift of either three principles, or five, are far from being fo ftrong ss thofe, that
I have employed to prove, that there is not any certain and determinate number of
fuch principles or elements to be met with univerfally in all mixt bodies. And, I
fuppofe, I need not tell you, that thefc anti-chymical paradoxes might have been
managed more to their advantage ; but that having not confined my euriofity to chymical
experiments, I, who am but a young man, and younger chymift, can yet be
but llcndcrly furnifhed with them, in reference to fo great and difficult a talk as you
impofed upon me : befides that, to tell you the truth, I durlt not employ fome even
of the beft experiments I am acquainted with, becaule I mull not yet dilclofe them.
But however, I think 1 may preiumc, that what I have hitherto difcourfed, will induce
you to think, that chymifts have been much more happy in finding experiments
than the caufes oi' them •, or in affigning the principles, by which they may beft be
explained. And indeed, when in the writings of Pi racelfus I meet with fuch phantattic
and unintelligible tlifcourfes, as that writer often puzzles and tires his reader
with, fathered upon fuch excellent experiments, as though he feldom clearly teaches,
I often find he knew ; merhinks the chymifts, in their iiarches after truth, arc not unlike
the navigators of Sokmen's TarJLifi} Rett, v.J,n brought heme from their long and
tedious voyages, not only goh!, and filvt r, and ivory, but apes and peacocks too :
for lb the writings of fever. 1 (for I lay not, all) of your hermetic philolophers prefent
us, together with divers fubftantkl and noble experiments, theories, which cither like
peacocks feathers make a great fliew, bw are nrirher folid nor ufeful ; orelfe like
apes, if they have fome appearance of b- ing rational, are bicmifhed with fome abfurdity
or other, that, when they arc attentively (.onfidered, make them appear ridiculous.
Carneapfs having thus finilhed his difcourfe againft the received doclrincs of the
element*, Eleutbtrhujw&emg he Ihouki not have tin.e to fay much to him before their
ftparation, made fome hake to tell him; I tonkls, Carnecdts^ that you have faid
more in favour of your paradoxes than 1 expected. 1 or though divers of the experiments

thit you have added many of your own unto them, you have laid them together In
Tuch a way, and applied them to fuch purpofcs, and made fuch deductions from them,
as I have nOt hitherto met with.
But though I be therefore inclined to think, that Pbi.'oponus, had lie heard you,
would fcarce have been able in all points to defend the chymical hypothelis againft the
arguments, wherewith you have oppofcd it ; yet methinks, that however your objections
feem to evince a great part ot what they pretend to, yet they evince it not all -,
and the numerous trials of thofe you call the vulgar chymifts, may be allowed to
prove fomething too.
Wherefore, if it be granted you, that you have made it probable ;
First, that the differing fubftances, into which mixt bodies are wont to be refolved
by the fire, are not of a pure and an elementary nature, efpecially for this rcafon,
that they yet retain fo much of the nature of the concrete that afforded them, as to
appear to be yet fomcwhat compounded, and oftentimes to differ in one concrete from
principles of the fame denomination in another •,
Next, that as td the number of thefc differing fubftances, neither is it precifely
three, becaufe in moft vegetable and animal bodies earth and phlegm arc alfo to be
found among their ingredients •, nor is there any one determinate number, into which
the fire (as it is wont to be employed) does precifely and univerfally rcfolvc all compound
bodies whatfoever, as well minerals as others, that are reputed perfectly mixt
:
Lastly, that there are divers qualities, which cannot well be refcrre I to any of
thefe fubftances as if they primarily refided in it and belonged to it ; and fome other
qualities, whicn, though they feem to have their chief and moft ordinary refidence in
fome one of thefe principles or elements of mixt bodies, are not yet fo deduciblc
from it, but that alfo fome more general principles mult be taken in, to explicate
them
:
If, I fay, the chymifts (continues Eleuiherius) be fo liberal as to make you thefe
three conceflions, I hope you will, on your part, be fo civil and equitable, as to grant
them thefe three other propofitions, namely
;
First, that divers mineral bodies, and therefore probably all the reft, may be refolved
into a faline, a fulphureous, and a mercurial part ; and that almoft au vegetable
and animal concretes may, if not by the fire alone, yet by a (kilful artift employing
the fire as- his chief inftrument, be divided into five differing fubftances, fait,
fpirit, oil, phlegm and earth ; of which the three former, by reafon of their being
fo much more operative than the two latter, deferve to be looked upon as the three
active principles, and by way of eminence to be called the three principles of mixt
bodies.
Next, that thefe principles, though they be not perfectly devoid of all mixture,
yet may without inconvenience be ftilcd the elements of compounded bodic?, and
bear the names of thofe fubftances, which they moft refemble, and which are mani-
Jertly predominant in them •, and that efpecially for this reafon, that none of thele
elemen s is divilible by the fire into four or five differing fubftances, like the concrete,
whence it was feparated.
Lastly, that divers of the qualities of a mixt body, and efpecially the medical
virtues, do for the moft part lodge in fome one or other of its principles, and may
therefore ufefully be fought for in that principle fevered from the others.
And in this alfo (puriues Eleuiherius) methinks both you and the chymifts may
eafily agree, that the fureft way is to learn by particular experiments, what differing
parts particular bodies do confift of, and by what ways (cither actual or potential fire)

they may beft and moft conveniently be fcparated, as without relying too much upon
tJie fire alone, for the refolving or bodies, fo without fruitlefsly contending to force

ufelefs.
These things (fubjoins Eltutberius) I propofe, without defpairing to fee them
granted by you ; not only becaufe I know, that you fo much prefer the reputation
of candour before that of fubtilty, that your having once fuppofed a truth would
not hinder you from imbracing it, when clearly made out to you ; but becaufe, upon
the prefent occafion, it will be no difparagement to you to recede from fome of your
pr.radoxes, fince the nature and occafion of your pad difcourfe did not oblige you to
declare your own opinions, but only to perfonate an antagonift of the chymifts.
So that (concludes he, with a fmile) you may now, by granting what 1 propofe, add
the reputation of loving the truth fincercly to that of having been able to oppofe it
iubtilcly.
Carneades's hafte forbidding him to anfwer this crafty piece of flattery; till I
/hall (lays he) have an opportunity to acquaint you with my own opinions about th«
controverfies I have been difcourfing of, you will not, 1 hope, expect I fhould declare
my own fenfe of the argument I have employed. Wherefore I fliall only tell
you thus much at prefent ; that though not only an acute n.uuralift, but even I myfelf
could take plaufiblc exceptions at fome of them •, yet divers of them too are fuch
as will not perhaps be readily anfwered, and will reduce my adverfarics, at leaft, to
alter and reform their hypothefis, I perceive I need not mind you, thit the objections
I made againft the quaternary of elements and ternary of principles, needed not to
be oppofed fo much againft the do&rincs themfelves ; either of which, efpecially the
latter, may be much more probably maintained than hitherto it feems to have been,
by thofe writers for it (I have met with) as againft the unaccuratcncfs and the unconcludingnefs
of the analytical experiments vulgarly relied on todemonftrate them.
And therefore, if either of the two examined opinions, or any other theory of
elements, fliall, upon rational and experimental grounds, be clearly made out to me*
it is obliging, but not irrational, in you to expect, that 1 fhall not be fo far in love
with my clifquieting doubts, as not to be content to change them for undoubted truths.
And (concludes Carneades fmiling) it were no great difparagement for a fceptic to confefs
to you, that as unfatisfied as the paft difcourfe may have made you think me with
i!ie do&rincs of the Peripatetics, and the chymifts, about the elements and principles,,
I can yet fo little difcover what to acquiefce in, that perchance the enquiries of other*
h.;ve icarce been more unfatisfaclory to me, than my own liave been to myfelf.

HAVING long fincc obfervcd, that a great part of the erroneous reafonings and
conclufions of learned men, as well about phyfical, as other fubjefts, proceeds
' not fo much from their making bad illations, as from their affuming falfe or uncertain

the time 1 allowed myfelf for chymical ihidies, if I employed fome part of it,
in examining the dodtrine about the principles of natural bodies. Upon this account
I did, in the year 1661, venture abroad my Sceptical Cbymifi^ to acquaint the inquifitive
with my doubts, and excite them to a more thorough difquifition of a fubjedt,
fo coofiderablc, as well to natural philofophy, as to phyfic. This difcourle
being once publilhed in Englifh, and foon after in Latin ; I thought fit to wait a
while, that I might learn what judgment would be made of it, and whether any of
the chymifts would return an anfwer to it : and in the mean while, to gratify thofe,
that appeared defirous of having it foon reprinted, I gathered divers notes (fome of
them confiderable for bulk) to be inferted here and there, as inlargements in the next
edition, whofe volume I was not unwilling fomewhat to increafe, not only becaufe I
thought truth in general, a thing worthy, that die lovers of it mould take pains to
difcover, and cftablilh it, but becaufe I looked upon the truth inquired after in the
Sceptical Cbymift, as of no mean importance ; cfpccially fincc the miltakcs, that very
many have made about it, have, I fear, not only been prejudicial to natural philofophy,
but have, by feveral men, as well learned as ignorant, been adopted both
into {he fpeculations, and practice of phyficians ; whole art being converfant about

the health and life of man, doctrinal errors in it cannot but be dangerous, and therefore
fit, as much as is poflible, to be folicitoufly avoided, or removed. Thefc inconveniencies
I hoped might in Come meafure be obviated, if it were further made appear
by experiments as weH as reafonings, that the vulgar doftrine of the tria prima
is, at leaft, very queftionable, or uncertain and very narrow. For the contrary perfuafions
about thefe principles have milled ,diyers learned men to give, and take up
with precarious and lupcrficial accounts of divers phaenomena of nature i by which
" means they have been diverted from employing their wits (wherein divers of them are
happy) in the invelligation of the true and fundamental caufes, the difcoycry whereof
would have enabled them, inllcad of dark, and fupcrficial, to give intelligible and
particular explications of thofe phenomena, and many others. The difference between
the accounts given of the fame phsenomena,, by the hypoftatical and by the
mechanical principles, may be feen exemplified* by particular inftances in other papers
; wherefore, I fliall proceed to oblerve as to phyfic, that befides the miIrakes,

which, 1 doubt, divers learned men have, by .another valuation of, the. do&rine of
the tria prima, been led into, in relation to the caufes of divers things, that occur to
human bodies, and even in chymical operations ; befides this, I fay, I fear, that the
too confident opinion of the doctrine I queftion has made divers practitioners of
phyfic make wrong eftimates of medicines. Hu,t after ( had waked ,a competent time,
I perceived no author vouchsafed the Sceptical jCbymi/l an anfwer •, but a very ingenious
man, from whom I chiefly expected it, told me, that he had indeed defigned to
write one, but was hindered by confidering, that I had fo ftatcd the cafe, that an
anfwer could not confute that book by any mere juftification of the chymifts principles,
fincc he would be obliged alfo to defend the chymical dodrine, as it is generally
taught by the vulgar chymifts and make good the arguments, by which they
arc wont to maintain it. Since it is only that doctrine and thefe arguments, that I declare
myfelf in that difcourfe to queftion i and he himlelf did not think them found
and valid. By thefc encouragements I was induced to comply with the earaeft felicitations
of the printer for another edition ; but he dying foon after, and the perfon,
to whom the right to difpofe of the Englifh copy legally came, having left England*
2nd continued out of it, for divers years, the dilpute between the Stationers that pretended
to it, and treated about it, lafted fo long, that a traveller, who pafled this way,
told an acquaintance of mine, that he had then (which was two or three years ago)
feen nine leveral Latin impreflions of it •, fince when another has been brought me
made at Genera. This number of editions (in none of which I have added or altered
a word) and the numerous citations I have met with of it, in favourable writers*
made me unwilling to confound, or trouble readers, by interweaving additional notes,
with the body of the difcourfe and fo by obliging thofc that ftiould hercaftw vouchfafe
to mention any of the infcrted paflages ot it, to cite the edition as well as the
book. And therefore I was eafily inclined, by want of health and leifure, to perufe
again deliberately the whole trcatife, to fupprefs all thofc notes, that I could not
readily and conveniently refer to three or four of the chief heads, I intended to enlarge
upon ; and without altering the form of the book, wherein it has proved fo
fortunate, to leave it imire, and publilh my additions alfo by themfelves by way of
appendix. This in my intention was to confift of four heads, The Produciblenefs of

to the three laft, titles, are not near fo large as thofe that belong to the firft ; yet they
would make the book, to which they Ihould be added, and which is already printed,
of too groat a thicknefs in. proportion to its other dimenfions j I thought fit to refcrve
the other papers for another opportunity, and at this time annex nothing, but
what concerns the Produtibltnefs of the cbymictlPrinciple!.
But yet becaufe there are lome general advertifemcnts that do fomewhat more belong
to this part of our defigned Appendix, that now comes forth, than to any of
the reft, I mud not deny them a room in this preface, which I fhall conclude with
them.
I mich r i
i.i (II v enough allege, in excufe of incoherence of fome of the particulars,
that follow next after one another in the fubfequent dil'courfe, that this being,
confufedly but a collection (or if you pleafe a rhapfody) of looi'c notes, it is more
pardonable, than ftrange, that fome of them mould want apt connections, and the
ltykof the ddcoorfc they compofe Ihould want uniformity. But it is not fo much
my prefent work to make apologies, as to give advertifemcnts ; and therefore I fhall
proceed to tell you in the rirft place, that though the following difcourfe have in fomc
places a fomewhat dogmatical drefs, yet it is chiefly meant (as becomes an appendix
to a fecptical book) to exeke and affift a further inquiry; and accordingly the reader
may, perceive it to have been my care, not fo much to play the part of a logical opponent,
as to take occafion to fet down variety of experiments and obfervations, that
whatever hypothefis about the material principles of mixed bodies fhall prove fit to
be pitched upon, it may be founded on a lefs infufEcient hiftory of matters of fact
(relating to that i'ubject ) than chymifts have been wont to take in ; and may be fo
framed, as not to be liable to thofc objections and difficulties, that will be here met
with, and yet perhaps were not thought of, or at leaft were not duly taken into confidoratien,
when the vulgar hypothefis of the tria prima was cftablifhed. Upon this
account I am not without hope, that the following experiments and confiderations,
though propofed by way of objections, may do fome fcrvice to the inquirers into the
material principles of things ; by obliging the chymifts, at leaft, to reform their doctrine
about them, and build it more cautioufly, and that upon a larger, as well as
more folid foundation of natural hiftory.
Th e fecond thing, whereof I am to advertife the reader, is, that I would not have
him infer from anything, that (prompted by the exigencies of my defign) I have faid
in the following papers, that I do either undervalue, or would decry chymiftry, or
chymifts themiclvcs indifcriminately. For I have a very differing eftccm of the
notional and of the practical part of chymiftry. For divers of the opinions maintained
by Spagyrifts, without excepting their grand hypothefis of the three principles,
I have been inclined to queftion, not only as a naturalift, but as a chymift ; as feeing
great cauic to doubt, whether they be agreeable, eidier to the true grounds of
philofophy, or the exploring experiments of the fire. But as for chymical operations,
fuch as diftillation, folution, fublimation, precipitation, and the reft , efpecially
thofc fcldom fufficiently valued ones, digeftion and cohobation ; I take them to be
excellent tools in the hands of a natural plulofopher, and to be by him applicable to
many other, and perhaps fome nobler ufes, than they are wont to be put to, in laboratories
; fince if they be fkilfully employed, they may be fuccefsfully fo, as well to
difcover nature, as to corrctt, to imitate, and, in fome cafes, to out-do her. Nor
do I only thus diftinguifh between the fpcculative and operative part of chymiftry,
but I make a great difference between the avowed cultivators of that art \ and look
not with the fame eyes on the opinions and performances of vulgar chymifts, and
chymical

chymical philofophers. For wc are told, that there lives concealed in the world a fett
of Spagyrifts of a much higher order than thofe, that are wont to write courfes of
chymiftry or other books of that nature \ being able to tranfimite bafer metals into
perfect ones, and do fome other things, that the generality of chymifts confefs to be
extremely difficult, and divers of the more judicious, even among the Spagyrifts themfelves,
have judged impoflible. The declaration of what I think of thefe latent
philoibphers, belongs to another paper. Yet in this, I (hall not deny, but that what
I have heard from divers very credible eye-witnefles, and perhaps fome more immediate
arguments, ftrongly incline me to think, that there may have been, and may
yet be, fome fuch men : and whatever be to be thought of what they call the philosopher's
ftonc, I confefs myfelf convinced by what I have feen, that there are in the
world as difficult arcana as divers of thofe, which have been (perhaps not all of
them juftly) derided under the name of chymical non-entia. Now if there be really
fuch adept philofophers as we are told of -, I am apt to think, that among their other
arcana, they are mafters of extremely potent menftruums (which may, as far as I
can guefs, be fome of their chiefeft tools) and may by the help of thefe and other
means peculiar to thcmfclves, of working upon bodies, be able to produce in them
fuch alterations, as we have no examples of, and fo obtain from them fuch fimilar
fubftances, as cither for number, or quality, or both, may be very different from
the vulgar tria prima, or thofe fubftances chymifts are wont to obtain (for that word
I chufe to employ rather than the word feparase or extract) by the common ways oi
what they call analyfis. For if a man have an inftrument, which other men have not,
and much more, if it be an excellent one, he may be able with it to perform other
things, than they can without. The Europeans by the help of fo flight an engine
as a mill, affifted by a far flighter inftrument a fieve, can eafily divide corn into bran,
and meal, and flour, which even thofe Americans, for want of thofe helps, were not
able to do, who could do other things, that are thought far more difficult. And he,
that has a file and a good turning lath with its appurtenances, may obtain from a
piece of iron both filings and fhavings, and concave hemifpheres, and ellipfes, and
globes, and cylinders, and other forts of bodies, which could not be obtained from
that iron, even by good artificers, that Were not furnifhed (as till of late very few
were) with thofe inftruments. And he, that firft found the ufe of aqua forcis in
ttifiblving filver, and that though it were mixt with gold, had, by his menftruum,
an cafy way of fcparating thofe two metals, though ancientcr mineralifts, nor chymifts
thcmtelves had no liquor that would perform that work. But HtlmonC% writings
will iupply me with a far nobler inftance to my prcfent purpofe, if the truth of all
that he delivers concerning the effects of his alkaheft be admitted; about the poffibility
ot which ftrange folvcnt, having cllewhcre written a fhort enquiry, I fhall forbear
to lay any thing of it here, but rather intimate, that if there be fuch adept
philof >phers as fome fpeakof, (which I think not incredible) and if they have (which,
luppofing there be fuch, I think not unlikely) among other rare things, fome alkaheitial
or other extraordinarily potent menftruum, or way of penetrating and working
upon mixt bodies ; they may, for aught I know, be able to obtain luch fubftances
from them, as may induce me, and perhaps the chymifts too, to entertain other
thoughts about the conftitution of compounded bodies (as they are wont to be called)
than either I, or they now have. And therefore, though as to natural philofophy in
general, I do not expect to fee any principles propofed more comprehenfive and intelligible
than the corpufcularian or mechanical-, yet as to the fubordinatc theory of
m:xt bodies in particular, 1, that have difputed only againft the vulgar hypothec's of

the chymifls, can eafily retain a difpofition to receive further light in thi matter,
when thofe, that are the beft able to afford it us, and from whom it will be no difparagement
for much greater proficients than I, to learn, fhall th nk fit to oblige
us by doing fo. In the mean time, to end this advertilement as I begun it ; I mould
not need to fay much to fatisfy chymifts, that I neither hate nor defpiie their art, even
in its prefent ftate, if fomc things, and chiefly want of leifure, would permit me to
publifh an effay that I wrote many years fince, Of the Ufefubttfs cf Cbymijlry to the
Empire of Man. Nor is it only to the practical part of natural philolophy, that'l
take chymiftry, as it may be managed, to be highly ufeful, but I confefs, I think
alfo, that being ordered by a fkilful naturalift, it may far more conduce, than thofe,
that are ftrangers to it are wont to think, to the fpcculative part of phyPicks •, and
that as the Bolonian (lone, without being, chymically prepared, would never be made
luminous, but being fo prepared is brought to mine; fo, many other natural bodies
never afford much light to philofophy till chymical operations have qualified them to
do fo.
The laft advertifement I defire to give the reader, concerns the intention, with
which I call in qucftion the hypothefis of the tria prima, and fomc other of the
chymifts doctrines. For though fometimes I have had occafion to difcovirfe like a
Sceptick, yet I am far from being one of that fed; which I* take to have been little
lefs prejudicial to natural philofophy than to divinity itfelf. I do not with the true
Scepticks propofe doubts to perfuade men, that all things are doubtful and will ever
remain fo (at lead) to human underftandings -, but I propofe doubts not only with
defign, but with hope, of being at length freed from them by the attainment of
undoubted truth ; which I feck, that I may find it; though if I mifs of it in one
opinion, I proceed to fearch after it in the oppofite, or in any other where it fcems
more likely I mould meet with it. And to declare my mind to the difciples of
the fire, by a fimilitude not alien from their profeffion ; fuppofc a man, more
rich than fkilful, fhould bequeath me a purfe of guineas, and that I fhould have
ftrong prefurnptions, that fome of them are counterfeit, what in this cafe would a
chymift have me do ? To take them all for good, in fpite of contrary prefurnptions
againft fome of them, were very imprudent. On the other fide, to throw them all
away, becaufc it is probable fomc may prove counterfeit, were downright folly. That
then, which common prudence would direct me, would be to take them all
out, and examine them one by one, firft with the touch-ftone, and then, if need be,
by the cupel, and by aqua fortis too : and this I fhould do with defire to find till the
pieces true, having alfo care not only to preferve and put back into the purfe thofe
that prove right ; but if any be but partly adulterated, to preferve the good portion
by purifying it (by the cupel or fome other fit way) from the falcifying alloy, by
whofe admixture it had been imbafed. The application of this I leave to be made
by chymifts. And having, in another paper, purpolely difcourfed of the cautions
and limitations, without which I difallow fcepticifm, I fhall only in general profels,
that I more willingly embrace the truths taught by the chymifts, than 1 endeavour to
difprove their errors. For I look upon truth, as one of the chief of thole goods,
that God has of all others laid the moft in common ; fince truth does not only, like
defert iflands in America, belong to him, that firft finds it and feizes on it; but even,
when another has lighted on it, and is in pofTeffion of it, any man may, without
trefpafs or injury, make himfelf a fharer in it. To conclude ; 1 am glad to find
truth in the doctrines of the chymifls ; but when I cannot difcern it there, I chafe
rather to feck it clfcwherc, than fit down without it. And if 1 any where fecm to

be fomewhat too indulgent to.fufpicions againft their hypothefis, or arguments, I
hope the ufuai confidence, to be met with among moft of them, confidered, it will
be looked upon but as a compliance with the advice of Ariftotk, of bending a
crooked ftick the contrary way, to reduce it at length to ftraitnefs. And I did, with
die lei's fcruple, allow myfelf this way of writing, becaufe experience having taught
me, that fome Spagv rifts (for 1 fpeak not of all) that keep their beft things elofe,
will do more to vindicate their art, or oppofc their antagonifts, than to gratify the
curious, or benefit mankind ; I thought the roufing ftyle, 1 fometimes wrote in,
might prove no unhopeful way to procure fomewhat confiderabk from thofe great
mafters, and orders ot chymical arcana, that muft be provoked, before they will
come out with them ; as the lea is obferved not to give us one of its precioufeft treafures,
ambcrgrcafe, till it have been agitated by winds and ftorms.
The Publiftier's Advertifement to the Reader.
I SHALL not entertain the reader with any thoughts of my own, about the
following Appendix, which, without defiring to prepofTcfs him, I ihall willingly
(and I think may lately) leave to fpeak for itfelf. But yet I think it may not be
amifs, if I premife fomething to the reader, about the publication of thefc notes, as
having been particularly concerned in it.
By the opportunity I had of feeing fome papers of the honourable author of the
enfuing Appendix ; I perceived, that the notes, which he defigned it fhould confift
of, were indeed moft of them laid together in fome (though out a carelefs) order,
and fo were without much difficulty fitted for the prefs : but others of them lay fcattered
up and down amongft many others, about differing fubjects in his philofbphical
memorials, which particulars not being ready at hand, when the enfuing Notes were
fent to Oxfcrd to the printer, dicy could not be publifhed with the reft, but muft
expect fome other opportunity to appear abroad, either alone, or in their company.
Pcrhaps the reader will not need to be told, that befides the application of lomc
of the experiments contained in the following Notes, moft of the experiments themfclvcs
are new. But fo many years arc pad betwixt the firft edition of the Sceptical
Cfamift, and the fecond, that now comes forth ; that it may be requifite (though
otherwife it would be improper) to advertife this reader, that he is not to th nk, that
the author has borrowed from others thofe experiments and notions, that may be met
with in books written in later years, as well as in the Sceptical Cfymijl. For the firft
li.nglifh edition having been put forth in the year i66x, and never fince by the author
at all enlarged, or altered; it will fufficiently fhew, that this book could not borrow
from thole, that never were feen till after, and perhaps long after his was publifhed.
Which advertifement may be particularly applied to the late learned treatife, intitled
Pbilefopbia Vetus £s? Nova, wherein in one long chapter may be met with an abridgement
of a great part of the notions, experiments, and ratiocinations of the Sceptical
Cbymijt, without any mention there made, either of the great and famous author's
name, or his book, in which they firft appear ; though the Latin verfion of that
treatife was publifhed many years ago, and reprinted many times fince. And though

this be not the only writer, that hath thought fit to make ufe of confidcrable portions
of the Sceptical Cbymifl, without owning it, I thought, what he lias been picked to
do, required to have particular notice taken of it, becaufe, though his modedy hath,
perfuaded him to conceal his name, his learned book hath made him fo juftly famous,
that if the reader were not advertifed, he might eafily fufpecd, that Mr. Beyle had not
lent to, but borrowed of an author, who appears fo capable of enriching the curious
with excellent things of his own. And upon the fame grounds I think it nectflary
to obferve, that the experiments to be met with in Mr. Boyle's Hi/lory of Colours having
been publifhed many years ago, could not be borrowed from that moft ingenious
treatife, though in that chapter of it, which treats de cdoribus, between 20 and 30
experiments (if I mif-remember not the number) will be found the fame with the
like number of Mr. Boyle's ; whofe name, though elfewhere very civilly taken notice
of on fome other occafion, is in the whole chapter left unmentioncd.
I might here inform the reader, that the Sceptical Cbymift having been many years
out of print, it chanced, that when the notes, that make up the following Appendix,
were drawn together for the prefs, this author had not a book at hand, by comparing
whereof with the particulars of his dcfigned Appendix, he might be fure to avoid
(what he now but hopes he hath) the fuffering any tiling to pafs in the latter, that is
truly coincident with what was already extant in the former : (I mean, to the fame
purpofe, and on the fame occafion for otherwife, an experiment or notion may be
more than once employed without mere repetition.)
And laftly I dare not omit to let the reader know, that fince the Appendix was
printed, it appears, that by an overfight, (bme leaves were left behind, that treating
of the difference of common mercuries thnufclvcs, mould have been annexed, as a
kind of appendix to the laft of the three mercurial tratts, to be met with among the
following papers : from whofe pcrufal the reader Ihall no longer be detained by

The Introduaion to the following NOTES.
THOUGH the pompous title of Hypoftatical Principles, which chymifts have
bellowed upon the ingredients they would have mixt bodies to confift of, has
perhaps ferved to procure them a veneration from vulgar heads, that are wont to
efteem things the more becaufe they underftand them lefs ; yet the main thing, that
has recommended the chymical principles to more difcerning men, fcems to be, that
by the help of a few fimple ingredients (whereof nature is iuppofed to have laid up
great magazines at the beginning of things) afTociatcd in dilfering proportions, all
mixt bodies may be compounded •, and fo men may acquaint themfelves with the
natures of a multitude of bodies, by firft knowing the nature* but of a few. He
therefore, that acknowledges he does not acqtiiefce in the chymical hypothefis of the

proper argument to fhake it, than, upon good ground, to call in queftion what they
teach when they affirm, that their principles are ingenerable and incorruptible ; and
that nature does only compound and diflbciate them, without either producing or
deftroying any of them. It will be therefore very well worth while to examine,
what evidence there is in an aflertion, which, in fo many of the chymifts reafonings
and explications, is either manifeftly imployed, or not obfeurely fuppofed. And indeed
this tenet of theirs is fo principal a pillar of their hypothecs, that, in cafe it fail
the m, the whole ftructure will be in danger of ruin. For if the bodies they call
principles be produced de rtcvo, how will it be dcmonftrable, that nature was obliged
to take thofc principles made ready to her hand, when ftie was to compound a mixt
body ? and how will it appear in every analyfis made by fire, that the fait (for
inftance) thereby obtained, was not produced by the chymical operations, but was
w.'.s pre-exiftent in the body in minute parts, which, by the action of die fire, were
only extricated and feparated from the other principles or ingredients, and afterwards
brought together ? Since, in cafe the chymical luppofition be erroneous, not only
the obtained fait may be in part due to a new production or tranfmutation, but part
of that, which was really fait, if any fuch tiling there were antecedently to the
analyfis, might be cither deftroyed by the operation, or made to appear under fome
other form.

Produciblenefs of Chymical Principles.
PART L
Of the Produciblenefs of Salt.
AMONG the tibftances, upon which chymifts have conferred the title of
principles, fait feems in their cftimate to have had the precedency, fince they
arc wont to name it firft in the enumeration of their tria prima. And it is generally
granted, that falts are wont to be the mod confiderable and active parts obtained by
chymifts from mixt bodies. And yet perhaps the invifiblc particles, that compofe
the vifible portions of a fait, may be luch, and fo contrived, as to be fit to make,
and to have perhaps actually made, other portions of matter endowed with thole
qualities, for which chymifts are wont to call a body fulphureous or mercurial, as
may be inftanced in the inflammability of nitre. Wherefore it may deferve a greater
mcafure of curiofity, than feems to have been employed, or even defigned, by vulgar
chymifts, to enquire, whether fait, indefinitely fpeaking, may be produced de novo,
(as they phrafe it) or deftroyed j and whether at leaft the particular, and much diftering
ipecics of falts may be changed into one another, and thereby, alter a manner,
be produced in reference to the acquired fpecies of fait, and deftroyed in relation to
that, which the fame portion of matter belonged to before.

To premife fomewhat in general, to render it probable, that falts may be produced
ie novo* I mall briefly reprefent two things ; the firft is, that fince i'alts differ much in
fcveral other attributes, ibme being mixt, fome volatile, fomc acid, ibme urinous,
&c. the two qualities, wherein they agree, and which therefore make up the common
and molt received notion of fait in general, arc, that it is eafily diflbluble in water,
and that it affects the palate with a fapor, whether good or evil : and the other thing
is, that, whether we allow the Epicurean hypothefis, or the Cartcfian, the firft falinc
concretions, that were produced by nature, mult be confefled to have been made of
atoms, or of particles, that before their conjunction, were not falinc. And therefore
there appears no abfurdity in conceiving, that by the action of the fire or other
fit agents, final! portions of matter may be fo broken into minute parts, and thefe
fragments may be fo ftiapcd and connected, as, when they are duly aflbciatcd, to
compote a body capable of being diflblved in water, and of affecting the organs of
tafte.
That a difpofition to be diflbluble in this or that liquor may be acquired by mixture,
and the new texture of parts, is not without example ; for, as I clfewhcrc obferve,
though powdered fulphur will lie in well rectified fpirit of wine, fome weeks
or months, without being at all vifibly diflblved in it ; and though the fame liquor
will for as long a time fwim upon fait of tartar, without making a folution of it •, yet
if this fait and fulphur be mixt together, fpirit of wine will in lefs than an hour,
and fometimes in lefs than a quarter of that time, diflblve enough of this matter to be
richly coloured by it, and this without the help of external hrat. And I fee not,
why it fhould be impoflible, that the action of the fire may reduce the corpufcles of
bodies to fuch a minutenefs, and aflbciate them cither among thcmfclvcs, or with the
corpufcles of other bodies, which, without preparation, will not diflblve in water,
that the pores intercepted between them may be entered, and their loofe texture diflblved
by that menftruum. Of which conjecture though we have not a perfect inftance,
yet we have a probable one in that, which I fhall hereafter deliver concerning
the making of fixt nitre. For though the cryftals of well purified falt-petrc may be
kept many weeks or months in an ordinary lodging-chamber (for I had not occafion
to try it in a cellar) without relenting by the inoifture of the air-, yet if without the
addition of any body diflbluble in water, or moift air, it be in great part reduced,
as perhaps it may be almoft in a trice, to a fixt alkali, this fait will be eafily enough
penetrable by the vapours, that rove up and down in the air •, and will by that moifture,
in no long time, be brought to relent, and at length will be rcfoived into a liquor
very analogous to that, which the chymifts make of fait of tartar left in moilt
cellars to dcliquate.
As for the fapor, which is the fecond qualification to be cnp.fklcred in the vulgar
notion of a faline body, I doubt, whether the neccftity of it be agreeable to another
principle of theirs, and to experience. For it is plain, that chymical oils, even
thefe pure ones they call tjfential, or even ethereal ones, arc highly fapid : and yet
thefe not diflblving in water, it feems there is no ftrict connection betwixt being faporous,
and being folublc in that liquor; and that, if ho lies bt reduced into a multitude
of pares minute and lharp enough, it is very p->ffible, that fome of thefe, cither
in part, or in conjunction with others, may acquire a fr/c and ihape, tha: fin than
fenfibly to affect the organ of taite, though perhaps the bodies themfelvcs, or perhaps
thole bodies, that afforded them, are more of ibme other nature than of a laline.

the organs of touch, may be conceived to be done upon the organs of tafte (which,
is a kind of touch) of which an ahnoft full inftance may be given in purified
lalt-pctrc. For though this concrete have but a faint and languid tafte, yet
if it be carefully diftilled with fome additamcnt, that is not diflbluble-in water, and
is infipid, the parts of it being, by the action of the fire, either broken afunder, or
cleft, or rubbed, or ground againit one another, till they are reduced to edged and
pointed corpufcles ; falt-pctre, I fay, thus treated will be refolved into differing fubftances,
each of which has an extremely ftrong and penetrant tafte, which, whence
it fhould proceed but from fome fuch mechanical change, as we have been defcribing,
is not eafy to declare : and perhaps alfo the phlegmatic liquor, that is wont to come
over in this analyfis, may, at leaft as to part of it, be produced by the operation of
the fire, and fo the phlegm being infipid, the tafte, I mean as much as was in the
urunalyzed nitre, may be as well deftroyed, as thofe of the fpirit and alkali are generated
by the operation of the fire. But perhaps there needs no other argument, that
the fame parts of matter, according to its differing ftates, may have the qualities,
that chymifts would have to be proper to this or that principle, than what we have
took notice of in chymical oils, which do more ftrongly affect the tafte, than the molt
of falts themfclves are found to do. And to confirm our doctrine of the producible-

fulphur and mercury, befides a terra damnata, the fame portions of matter, that preexilted
in the form of cither of thofe fimple ingredients, muft, by the operation of
the fire, and an anomalous menftruum, have been turned into fait j and if the Hclmontian
experiment be allowed of, whatever becomes of the chymical fuppofition,
we may fafcly conclude, that fait may be made of matter, that was not fait before,
and confequently that fait may be de novo produced. And thus much of the pofilble
origination of falts in general, which I thought fit to premife to what I am going to
offer about the production of the particular forts of fait. Though I have elfcwhere
enumerated and diftinguilhed fevcral kinds of thefe bodies, whereto chymifts have
given the title of falts ; yet thofe, that more properly dclcrvc that name, and more

Of the production of acid falts.
A ND to begin with acid falts, we fee, that even fwect wines will but too often*
without addition, degenerate into four vinegar, which will diflblve coral and
divers (tones, calcined lead, and feveral other minerals. The rain-water, that is imbibed
by the roots of trees, is in thofe, that bear limons and barberries changed into
liquors, abounding with faline corpufcles, that enable them to affeft the tafte, and
aft on powdered pearls, and feveral other bodies, as acids are wont to do. Alfo.
guaiacum and divers other woods, that do not at all tafte four, will, being diddled
in retorts, afford fpirits, that are furniftied with dore of acid particles, which, as I
have tried, will hifs upon alcalics, and will diflblve coral, and even lead itfclf calcined
into minium, and make faccbarum Saturni of it. Many other vegetable bodies
alfo do, without addition, afford the like acetous liquors. And if it be objected*
that thefe were pre-cxident in the bodies, whence they were obtained, and were only
extricated by the operation of the fire it will concern thofe, that affirm this, to*
prove it (which no body, that I have met with, hath yet done) : and 1 (hall the rather
require it, becaufe I find, that the fwectcft bodies, and thofe of differing kinds, as
(to omit raifins of the fun) fugar and honey themfelves, afford fuch a fort of fpirits,
which the trials, I elfewherc mention, Ihcw to be (harp and piercing enough. Towhich
may be added, that in divers cafes, where we are fure, that acid fpirits were
plentiful ingredients of a compofition, as in faccbarum Saturni, and that magideryr
which the chymids call fait of coral (which are not the only mixtures I have made
trial of) experience witneffeth, that the liquor, which comes over by didillation in>
retorts, is not acid, but quite of another kind. I would not, by what has been
faid, be concluded to deny, that acid falts may, in fome mixt bodies, be fo affociatcd
with others, and obfeured by them, as not to be difcerniblc by the tadc, till they be
frparated by the operation of the fire. But tofticw, that fuch acid falts were dt faclo
pre-cxident, as acid ones in the body, that affords them, there mud be fome pofitive
proof, other than the liquors diftilled from them, fincc they, as we have already
argued, may be not barely extricated, but may have their acidity produced by the
operation of the fire. And we fee, that falt-petre, though it have no acid tafte, may
be made to afford, by (a certain way of) diftillation, above three quarters of its
weight of a highly acid liquor ; and yet it appears not, that fuch a great proportion
of acid particles, or poflibly any confiderable proportion at all, was employed by
nature in the compofition of falt-petrc. At leaft, having diftilled earth, that I caufed
in my own prefcr.ee to be dug out of a pigeon houfe below the dung; I had from it
a fait indeed, and ibme little faline liquor, but of a nature, as far as I obferved, very
differing from th.u of the acid i'pirit of nitre. (But this experiment I mention occafionally,
without building upon it.)
Nor do I think, it Ought to feem incredible, that acid falts, as well as others*
fliould be producible by the various fplittir.gs, attritions, coalitions, and changes of
texture, which may be caufed feveral ways, and efpccially by the operations of the
fire; which mod aftive agent, making a vehement and various agitation of all the
minute parts, that a body confifts of, may, confonantly to what hath above been intimated,
fplit or break lomc of them, and as it were grind others againft one anodier;

mechanical origin of talks wherefore I now proceed to the fecond part of my talk.
SECT. II.
Of the produtlion of volatile falls.
AS to the production of volatile falts, we have an eminent inftance of it in the
fait obtainable by diftillation from foot ; for though the woods we burn in our
chimneys fecm not to have any tiling of the tafte or fmell of urinous fait, nor have
the d iflolutions of the faline parts of fuch woods communicated to water by their infufion
in it, been obferved (that I know of) to be of affinity in tafte or odour with
the fait of foot ; yet when wood is firft burnt in the fire, and then the foot afforded
by it is duly diftilled and rectified in fitly fhaped vcflcls, there is obtained a fpirit and
a white volatile fait, that in fmell, tafte, and divers operations, by which we have
examined them, appear to be of great affinity with thofe of human blood, or urine,
and may be eafily enough miftaken for them.
Birr this double operation of the fire is not always neccflary to the production of
volatile falts out of vegetables. For, though by their diftillation in retorts we generally
obtain from them no dry fait at all, but a fourifh fpirit, with which I have diffolvcd
coral, lead, and other hard bodies, that urinous fpirits have not been obferved
to work on ; and they will, being put upon urinous falts, make fuch an hiffing and
conflict, as arc looked upon as great tokens of antipathy: yet I remember, that
fcvcral years ago, I did from muftard-fced, that had been kept for a convenient time,
obtain by diftillation a volatile fait, that fattened itfelf in prettily figured grains to
the upper part of the receiver, and this at the very firft diftillation ; fo that there
was no need of rectifying the diftilled matter, to feparate that fait. And to enforce
this proof by fomcthing more confidcrablc than itfelf, I fhall add, that by an eafy
way by word of mouth communicated to me by a very ingenious pcrfon (Dr. D. E.)
one may, out of very many vegetables firft duly prepared, without adding any thing
to them, by bare diftillations in retorts, obtain good ftorc of volatile fpirits and falts,
which by their fugacity, colour, fmell, tafte, and divers experiments, that I purpolely
made to examine them, were fo like the fait and fpirit of urine, foot, &c. that
one, that knew nothing of the way they were made by, would readily have concluded
they belonged to one or other of the newly named forts of bodies.
1 remember, that I have alio fomctimcs produced a volatile fait, that one would
readily have pronounced urinous, of a mineral itfelf ; nor was that the only foflile,
from which experience perluaded me, that fait of this kind might be obtained.
Some other particulars relating to the production of volatile falts, I think fit to
refcrye, till I fhall have occafion to mention them in another feCtion (as inftances of
the production of urinous fpirits). Only there is one thing, that I think not fit here
to pretermit, becaufe I have not met with it in any chymical writer, die contrary
being rather generally taken for granted. I fhall add then, that it is not univerfally
true, that faline fubftances, that are volatile and afcend in the form of fait, are of
an urinous nature, and enemies to acids. For I have had from veriiigreafe, diftilled
prft with a ftrotig fire, a very acid fpirit; which being warily rectified, afforded firft

to reft, did in a great part ftioot into tranfparcnt cryftals, large but thin, almoft like
thofe of iilver, diflblved in aqua fortis. They appeared prettily figured at the edges,
but were lb oddly connected among thcmfelvcs, that I was noi able to refer them to
any of the known geometrical figures ; and their brittlenefs made them the lefs
tractable, but their fmcll, which was ftrangcly piercing and not inoffenfive, argued
them to be of the fame nature with the acid Ipirit, which had come over with them.
But there is a more conftant and cafy way of producing fuch a volatile fait, as my
oblervation mentions. For if amber be gradually and warily diftilled, it will afford,
befides the phlegm, ipirit and oil, a dry Jubilance, which, though the chymifts call
the volatile fait of amber, I found to be really of an acid nature, by fevcrai of
thole trials, by which wc arc wont to difcern, that a body belongs to the family of
acids.
SECT. nr.
Of the production of alkalies or lixiviate falts.
THE third and laft fort of falts, which we arc to endeavour to fhew to be pro-»
ducible, are the alkalies or fixt falts j which feem to have an antipathy with
acid ones, by making a conflict with them, and excrcifing divers operations contrary
to theirs (as I have in another difcourfe more fully declared.)
As for the origin of thefe fixt falts of burnt bodies, the Spagyrifts are not of the
fame mind about it. For, the almoft univerfal opinion of the chymifts, that preceded
Helmcnt, and the more common opinion even of later chymifts, feem to have
been, that thele fixt alkalies are pre-cxiltcnt in mixt bodies ; and that the fire docs fa£frT
but feparate or extricate them from the other parts of the compounded body. But *"""••»
Helmont (followed in that by feveral chymifts, that diflent from him in other points) 5 '
has ingenioufly conjectured, that thefc lixivial falts do not pre-exift in their alcalizate
form in the bodies, that afford them, but are productions of the fire, by whole
violent action a part of the fait, which, in the concrete, is naturally all volatile, lays
hold of fome parts of the fulphur of the fame body, and both together are coliiquatcd
and fixt into an alkali which fixation he fomewherc exemplifies by that,
which happens, when fait -petrc and arfenic, that are both volatile, being expofed to
the fire, are by its operation fluxt and made to fix one another. But though this account
be ingenious, yet I doubt, whether it be fo clear and fatisfactory, efpccially
fince it is applied to all fixt alkalies, as the embracers of it think it. For befides,
that it may be queftioned, whether it have yet been well proved (what Helmont r^n's,
teaches) that all the fait of mixt bodies before their combuftion is volatile, it is not fij^?
declared, what volatile fait is meant ; though it be plain, that fome bodies, that afford
a fixt fait, do abound in acid fpirits, as oak, box, and many other vegetables ; and
others, as hartfhorii, blood, urine, 6V. abound with urinous falts, that exercife
hoftility with acids : and I have found, that from fome bodies I could obtain both
acid fpirits, and fuch as are wont to be called urinous. It is not eafy to explain how
the volatile fait comes to unite itfelf fo intimately with the oil (or fulphur) and
though it be alio volatile itfelf, to compofe with it a body capable of enduring tl>e
violence of the fire, fince we have more than once tried, that the volatile fait of urine,
or of hartfhorn, and a chymical oil, as of turpentine or any fuch, being put together,
the fait will indeed alTociate to itfelf fome particles of the oil, but will nevcrihclefs
in their company fublime in the form of a fair, with a very gentle fire. And
600 Tbs Produciblbness of
™'£m examPk» tnat Helmont fomcwhcre gives of arfenic and nitre, does not fatisfy me,
Cmfka. becaufe that when I made equal parts of thofe two bodies to be mingled, and in a
•gmtitifl. ftrong crucible fulminated together, a great part of the mixture was driven away by
the fire, fo little altered, that it is very dangerous to be too bold with the fumes, and
a good part of what remained was fixt only, in comparifon of the crude arfenic, but
not comparably to fait of tartar, or fome fuch other true alkali : and the conftancy
of the part, that was more fixt, may probably be afcribed to the falt-petrc, which
we know will, without the help of arfenic, afford a great deal of fixt fait, if about
half of it be burnt away, by the help of powdered charcoal, or fome other convenient
additament. It may alfo ferve to weaken this inftancc of HeImont's1 that
there are other inftances, in which we may obferve, that no fuch thing happens, as
his hypothefis may make one expeft. For common fulphur is by chymifts faid to
abound in an oily part, upon whole account it is very inflammable, infomuch that
they would have other inflammable bodies to be fo, by their participating of fulphur.
That this concrete alfo abounds in fait, is evident, according to their principles, by
the acid menftruum afforded by it, that goes under the abufive name of oleum fulphurtsper
camfanam. And yet thefc ingredients, combined by nature, make up a concrete,
which is fo volatile, that both in clofe veffeb and the open fire, it is almoft
totally volatile. And in that mixture of highly dephlegmed fpirits of wine and
urine, that Helmont calls the Offa albay though the urinous falts do manifeftly combine
themfelves with the fpirit of wine, which being totally inflammable, the chymifts
refer to their oil, or fulphur •, yet the coagulated mixture does not, by this aflbciation
of ingredient*, grow fixt, but proves very volatile. I will not here urge, in favour
of the common opinion of the chymifts of the pre-exiftence of alkalies in mixt
bodies, that a corpufcularian may fay two not inconfiderable things ; whereof the firft
is, That there is no need of fuppofing a colliquation of falts with fulphurs, oils or
any thing elle to produce fixt falts •, Mice, beiides that that fuppofition does not explain,
how two volatile bodies come to compofe one that is fixt, it is plain, that a
body yet more fixt may be made without any aflbciation of differing principles. For
the earth, that together with the alkali remains in the afhes of a burnt body, is more
fixt than the alkali itfelf, and yet derives not its fixity from any combination of elements,
or principles, but from the groflhefs, folidity, or weight, and unfitnefs for
avolation of the corpufcles it confiils of. And the corpufcularian may add in the -
fecond place, that whereas fome inftances are alleged, wherein there is fuppofed a
leflening of the quantity of the fixt alkali of the concrete, by operations, that are
faid to carry off the volatile fait, before the body comes to be incinerated ; it may
be anfwered, that perhaps thofe very operations did but rarify and volatilize part of
the pre-exiftcnt alkali, and fo left the lefs of it to be recovered by burning •, as the
chymifts tell us, that fermentation ratifies the oily parts of the juice of grapes, and
fubtilizes them into vinous fpirits, and fo does much leflen the quantity of the oiL
And when wood is burnt in a chimney, it is not in the form of an acid fair, which is
the only, that is commonly obferved to be driven away by diftillation in clofe vcfiels,
but in that of an urinous fait (which is a-kin to alkalies, and an enemy to acids) that
the faline part of the wood is made to afcend ; as may appear by the diftillation of
foot. Such arguments as thefe a corpufcular philofopher might, as I was faying,
urge in favour of the more received fpagyrical opinions. But inftead of inlifiing on
them, I flial] only invite you to take notice of what I obferve in falt-petre. For,
though by diftillation, or any other way, that we yet know, there is no oil to be fcparated
from it ; yet above half the body of it may be eafily and quickly turned

into a fixt fait, in colour, tafte, and operation, much like that of tartar, and other
incinerated vegetables. And fuch an alkali I have made without the help of injected
coals, or any other body, furniflicd with a combuftiblc fulphur : fo that it
fecms not, at lead univerfally, true that to the production of an alkali there is
necefTary to be at hand an oil, or fulphur, to be laid hold on by die volatile fait, and
fixt together with it. But this experiment is far more congruous to our doctrine,
which derives all thofe falts from the fize, fliape, and folidity or weight of the fame
corpufcles fince the fame falt-petre, whofe greater portion may, by the operations
newly mentioned, be reduced to a fixt alkali, may, by being diftilled with a convenient
bolus, have its greater portion brought over in the form of an acid fpirit or
laic, which itfelf may afterwards be made materially to concur to the production of
an alkali. I might add, that even from one of * Ilelmont's own experiments, my
conclufion may be inferred, fince he fomcwherc, and, if I miftake not, in more
places than one, affirms, that by the addition of more alkalizate fait and the operation
of the fire, the earth itfelf, that is in the afh.es, may be turned into fait ,
which, if true, argues, that a fixt fait may be made of that, which was not before,
either of faline, or of an oleous nature ; and confequently without any fuch combination
of fait and oil, or fulphur, as his hypothefis fuppofes. From which experiment
I may alfo infer the poffible origination of alkalies, by the mechanical changes,
that, without the addition of oil or fulphur, the operations of the fire may produce
in the part of a mutt body ; fince earth (excepting water) feems the moft indilpofed
of any part of the concrete to be turned into fixt fait.
I must nor here pretermit an obfervation, that I have made, which feems to overthrow
the opinion of thofe learned chymifts, who will have the violence of the fire
to be always a neceffary agent, as I allow it to be ordinarily, to the production of a
fixt or lixivial alkali. I faid feems to overthrow, becaufe I had not the opportunity
to repeat my trials, and am not fure, that the fait I employed was altogether
genuine, in regard I cannot here in London meet with it, at any rate ; but I have
great caufe to think it was right, both for other rcafons, and becaufe it was fent with
other things, for a prcfent out of the Eaft, to an inquifitive nobleman, who had been
lately ambaflador for his Britifli Majcfty, at the Ottoman court, and who was pleafed
as a rarity to prefent it me.
This fait was affirmed to be the true Egyptian nitre, mentioned fo much by antient
writers : and indeed I found it to agree much better with the notion, that books had
given me of it, than with that fort, to which chymifts generally give the name of
nitre, and which is indeed the only nitre to be ufually met with in our European
(hops j where it is bed known by the vulgarly received name of falt-petre. But to
fay fomething of our Egyptian nitre, though it be not pertinent to mention here all
that I obferved about it, yet I mult not here omit two things, that I made trial of,
with that little, which efcaped the misfortune that loft me all the reft, that feem confiderable
in the prefent occafion.
The firft whereof is, that this Nilotic fait was very apt to imbibe the moid air, as
calcined tartar and other fixt alkalies are wont to be j to which refolution we do not
find our fait petre, if it be unmixed, difpofed. But the other and more important
thing I obferved, was this, that having upon this Egyptian nitre, crude as it was,

upon it, as if it were a fixt alkali, or at Icaft abounded with fuch a fixivial fait. And
here, upon the by, give me leave to take notice of a text of the holy Scripture, that
has fometimes puzzkd not only me,, but far better critics in the Hebrew tongue than
I, And it is a paflage to be round in the 2 5th chap, of Solomon's Proverbs, where,
to illuftrate things very incongruous to one another, the difagrccment of vinegar and
nitre is mentioned ; for fuppoling the words to be rightly tranflatcd, as befides the
authority of I know not how many verfions, the very found of the Hebrew word
meter or melhar argues it to be, it feems very hard to find, what fliow of antipathy
there is between vinegar and the falt-pctre, that is commonly fold in our fhops for
nitre. Wherefore ftrongly prefuming, that Solomon, who reigned in JutLea, a country
near to Egypt, and had much commerce with the Egyptians,, whofe King's daughter
he had married, made ufe of Egyptian nitre as the beft known, if not the only in his
time and country ; and might have found in this nitre fome quality very differing
Jn.3.ix. from any we find in our falt-pctre ; as I remember, that in the Prophet Jeremy nitre
is mentioned as a very abftcmve thing, and fit to clcanfe women's fkins, which is a
known virtue of our fixed alkalies, but not obferved in pure falt-petre : wherefore
when once I received the nitre, that I have mentioned, and faw in it figns of an alkalizatc
nature, I quickly poured upou it fome ftrong vinegar, and found, as I expected,
that there prefentty enfued a manifeft conflict, with noifc, and ftore of
bubbles} with which experiment I afterwards acquainted fome critics, and orher
learned men, who were not ill pleafed with it. But this theological ufe of the alkalizate
nature of nitre not being that, which I chiefly mentioned it for, I fliall now
make the philofbphical ufe 1 intended, by taking notice that Egyptian nitre being acknowledged
to be a native fait, and made only by the evaporation of the fuperfluotis
water of the Nile (or fome other fuch liquor) is yet of a lixiviate nature, or at leafl
abounds with particles that are fo: though, as I frcftily intimated, it was produced
without any precedent incineration, and the matter of it fullered not, or at lead
needed not fufier any violence of the fire to make it afford an alkali.
I have reprefented thefc things, not for thatlpretend to be furc, that alkalies may
not be produced in multitudes of mixt bodies, elpccially in a good number of vegetables,
after the way propofed by Helmont, or by fome fuch like ; but partly, becaufc
it feems not always necclfary to the cxiftence of an alkali in nature, and to be the
only way it can be produced by ; and partly, becaufc I would give you and your
chymical friends occafion to clear (as far as they can) and confirm the doctrine I hive
queftioned. It is true, that being a far greater friend to truth, than an enemy to
the chymicalhypothefis, I would not ftifle what may fcrvc to advance that, in favour
of Helmont's doctrine, though this would never fo well accommodate my prtfenc
argument. But I have no great temptation to furmount in this cafe, for it concern-?
very little the main fcope or this difcourfe, whether Helmcr.fs way, or any other, of
the production of alkalies be embraced ; fince it will fufficc for my purpofc, if fome
bodies belonging to this family, or kind of fait', may lie produced : I fay fome,.
bec aufc (as I have already intimated) I will not peremptorily alfcrt, that all fixed alkalies
are productions of the fire, or made by the help of it ; though I do not readily
remember, that I have met with any (except Egyptian nitre) that are not. But I
lhall wave that qudtion, becaufc my intended brevity calls upon me to proceed to
the mention of fome particular initanccs, fit to perfuade us, of the producibier.ef*
of fome alkalizate falts.

the fait of tartar, 6xed nitre, pot-afhes, or other fuch unqucftioncd alkalies That
lea-falt likewife docs not contain alkalies, is generally taken notice of, the fpirit of it
being juftly reckoned among the acid ones v and when I purpofely examined that concrete
by diftillation, the remaining fait, though the fire had been violent, was very
differing from alkalies : and yet my conjectures inclining me to fufpeft what the
event would prove, I feveral times made the following experiment upon fea-falt, that
yet retained all its acid fpirit in it.
Upon well dried and powdered fea-falt we put into a retort fometimes an equal,
and fometimes (which 1 prefer) a double weight of good fpirit of nitre, or aqua
fortis, and leifurely diftilling all that would come over, we took out the dry fait remaining
at the bottom, which we found much changed both as to colour (a good
part of it being ufually very reddifh) and as to tafte, which was differing enough from
what it had been before, and might probably have been made much more fo, if frcfli
fpirit of nitre had been once or twice more abltracted from it. This fair being again
powdered (for it was in a lump when taken out) and put into a crucible, placed in
a convenient fire, was by the repeated injection of fragments and well kindled charcoal
made to flafti divers times almoft like melted nitre •, and when it would flam no
longer, the remaining matter being taken out, did, in great part, appear to be
brought to an alcalizate nature, for it had a fiery tafte upon the tongue : if fpirit of
nitre or aqua fortis were poured on it, it would make an ebullition, it would
turn fyrup of violets green, and in fhort, exhibit divers phenomena of alkalizate
falts.
Another way there is like that mentioned of making an alkali out of nitre, which
is thus done ; pour upon it an equal weight, or half the weight of ftrong oil of vitriol
; and having diluted the mixture with a convenient proportion of fair water,
diftil it by degrees, till there remain a fubftancc very dry. Powder this, and mix it
well with about an eighth part of beaten charcoal •, keep them in fufion in a ftrong
and covered crucible, till the mafs grow very black, and a little of it being taken
out with a wire, tafte fiery upon the tongue (which may happen in about half an hour
or an hour, according to the quantity or matter, and degree of fire :) then take out
the blacked or deeply red mixture, which will very eafily imbibe the moifture of the
air, and you may find it, at leaft while it is hot and dry, of a more fiery lixivial tafte
than fait of tartar itfclf. It will make an ebullition with acid fpirits, and precipitate
divers folutions made with them ; it will turn fyrup of violets green, and in ftiort
difcover itfelf many ways to be of an alkalizate nature, though it be affociated
with a fulphur, that may, by divers methods, be made appear to be contained plentifully
in it.
It is alfo confulerablc on this occafion, how the fame body, without the addition
of any other fait, may by the various manner of the fire's application to it be made
to afford, cither little elle than acid falts, or a leffer or greater quantity of alkali
for if fine falc-petre be dcxteroufiy diuilled with about thrice its weight of fome fit
earth (bur not, as is ufual, with powdered brick*) it will fometimes afford very near
as much fpirit of nitre as the fait weighed ; and though this, like other liquors, be
not without phlegmatic parts, yet bcfidcs that it may be doubted, whether molt or
many of them were not produced by the tranfmuting operation of the fire, we may
fuppofe, that five parts of or fix tft" feven have been diftilled into dephlegmed
ipim.
4 H i But
The V RODUCIBLENESStf/
But if, according to the way I have elfcwherc * circumftantially delivered (which
is by frequent injecting into fluxed falt-petre fmall pieces of kindled charcoal, till
one can make it flail) no more at all) you make fixed nitre, you may obtain from
nitre thus handled half its weight, and perhaps better, of an alkalizate fait, that
many would, by its tafte and operations, guefs to be fait of tartar.
But to ftiew yet further, how much the production of this alkali depends upon
the operation of the lire, which, as it is varioufly applied, may vary the texture of
the falt-petre, my conjectures led me to try the following experiment, which I did
with fuccels from the beginning. We took a pound of good falt-petre, which was
but grofsly beaten (for it mould not be finely powdered) and having laid it on a
conical heap upon a fiat tile, that the air might on all fides have accefs to it, we caufed
the upper part of it to be kindled by a little fragment of burning coal (which may be
afterward thrown away.) Then wc caufed the laborant with an iron rod dcxteroufly
to ftir the kindled part of the nitre, that the ignition might be prefently communicated
to as many parts of the fait, as was polfible ; and this nimble ftirring of the mals,
that the fire might be more diffufed, and more parts might be obvertcd to the air,
we caufed him to continue to the end of the operation : by which method, within
few minutes, we obtained, more than once, out of fixteen ounces of falt-petre, about
ten ounces or better of fixed nitre, very lixivial in tafte and operation ; and for the
colour, it was of a pleafant greenifh blue, and deeper than fait of tartar will ufually
be brought to, by being (in a crucible) kept twenty times as long, in a good fire.
The other fcopes and ufes defiged in this new and quick way of making the alkali
of nitre belong to another difcourfe, the experiment, which will fcarcc fucceed
without a dextrous management, being here mentioned to fhew, what quantify of
alkalizate fait may by a differing operation of the fire be obtained from nitre ; which
(crude nitre) in diftillation fkilfully made for the purpofe may be in great part driven
oVer, in the form of acid fpirit, and phlegm, and leaves fo little true alkali behind
it, that I have wondered at it, being fometimes fcarce able to find any at all, though
1 purpbfely tried to feparate it from the tobacco-pipe clay, which the pctre had been
mixed with after a diitillation, wherein not half of the fait had been driven into the
receiver, in the form of fpirit.
And to (hew, that to make the fixed fait of nitre, the actual inflammation of it,
in the open air, is not ncccflary, as very learned men have fuppofed ; and that it U
poffible, whatever is prefumed to the contrary, to make an alkali nitre, though charcoal,
or lbme other com buftible body be not added to it, to kindle the cirpufclcs of
the nitre by its fulphur, and by the aflbciation of fomc part of the fame fulphur
with the faline parts of the nitre, to compofe an alkali ; to fhew this, I fay, 1 more
than once made the following experiment : with a convenient quantity of good fakpetre
wc carefully mingled about an eighth part of tobacco-pipe clay ; and putting
the mixture into a crucible clofcly luted at the top, we kept it by a fitly graduated
fire in fufion for lome hours, and found, as we expected, that the remaining fait (for
part would get through the lute, or commifiures in the form of fumes) was turned
into an alkali, of a fair blue colour, like the better fort of that fixed nitre, w.'iich
is made with charcoal. This experiment, and that formerly made with tobacco-pipe
clay, feem plainly to argue, that to the making of fixed nitre, which is confeffed to
be an alkali, a congruous change of texture may fufRce ; whether that change be

attempted to be made in open vcffels, or in clofe ones, with, or without the addition
of the fulphur of charcoal, or any other fuch combuftiblc body. Upon the fame
ground, that I had for trying the former experiment, I attempted, and not without
luccefs, to make an alkali oi fait petre, by colliquating moderate quantities of it,
feveral ways (and keeping it in fufion) with fomc metals: I fay, moderate quantities
of nitre, bccaiife an ingenious gentleman, to whom I communicated this practice,
could not make it fucceed in any confiderable quantities. And to obviate the fufpicion,
though perhaps groundlefs, that fome chymifts might have of the material concurrence
of a good portion of the combuftiblc fulphur, prcfumcd to be in the ignoblcr
metals to the production of the nitrous alkali ; I mail add, that our experiment fucceeded,
when we tried it more than once, with more than ordinarily fine iilvcr, whofe
fulphur, if it have any, is granted to be fixt or incombuftible. And I remember the
laft trials afforded us a bluifh alkali, though there were employed but a fifth part of
filver, in reference to the nitre ; and though the fire (which was continued for fome
hours) was fo moderate, that the metal, though thinly laminated, was not melted j.
and of an ounce, that was put in, there wanted but four grains, which fmall lofs
might eafily be imputed to divers accidents.
After what is laid of the production of lixiviate falts and alkalies, it will not be
impertinent to add, that as they may, by the operation of the fire, be produced ; fo
by the operation of the fire they may be deftroyed or defpoilcd of their aikalizate*
form, and turned into a fubftance of a nobler nature. This I am induced to think
very probable by fome experiments, amongft which, that which feemcd the moft confiderable,
was this : we took a pretty quantity of good fait of tartar, that had been
purified by folution and coagulation, and having put it into a clean crucible, we kept
it in a ftrong fire (that made the crucible red-hot) for a good while j then giving it at
length a iironger lire, we poured it or (afterwards) took it out of the pot, and diflblved
again as much of it as we could in cold water, which being fct to run through cappaper,
there appeared, as I forefaw, in the filtre a pretty deal of matter, that would
not (as the whole fait had done at firft) be diflblved in the water, but was turned into
a kind of earthy fubftance. Then coagulating again the folution, that had patted
through the filtre, into dry fait j we expofed it again in the crucible to a ftrong fire,
and putting it again into water, we perceived it would not totally diflblvc, but left in
the filtre a flime or mud. And in this manner we proceed to ignite, diflblvc, filtre,.
and coagulate the fame fait of tartar many times j for, if I much miftake not, it was.
fixtccn times, and ftill found fuch an earthy fubftance as has been fpoken of, remaining
in the filtre ; and the reft of the fait of tartar fo little altered, that being fomewfiat
tired, and other ways diverted, I delifted from profecuting the operation to the
Uttermoft concluding it highly probable, that the remaining fait might, by the fame
way of management, lie brought to yield more and more of that fsme fubftance,
which either was earth, or of kin to it, being at leaft fomcwhat, that was of a nature
very differing from fait of tartar, fince it was not like it, fiery on the tongue, and
was iiidiffoluble in water, as earih, but not (alt of tartar* is known to. be.

IT may bring fomc illuftration, and add fome probability to what has- been difcourfed
about the produciblenefs of falts, if we confider what happens in the compufit

and on one another. For if it appear, that» by thefc manifeft and mechanical ways*

fuch alterations may be made, and fuch qualities produced, as are either altogether,
or very near as considerable, as thole, which difcriminatc the feveral families or falts
formerly fpoken of, from one another, and from this or that chymical principle ; it
will, I prefumc, be judged the more credible, that thefe families of falts may be
either tranlmuted into one another, or othenvife produced \ and fo may not be primordial
and immutable beings, in the fcnlc, wherein the chymilb would have them
to be fuch. I have eliewhere taken notice of the production of vitriols, fal armoniac,
borax *, and divers other factitious falts ; for which realbn 1 I fhall not infift on them
here the rather, becaufe it may fuffice for my prefent puroofc to take notice of two
falts, whereof the one is meerly factitious, and the other fuch in great part •, and yet
each of thefe, by a very night' and eafy way of ordering it, afforded me differing
faline concretions, fome of which rcfcmblcd a fait, which many judge the moft fimple
and natural, that we yet know of.
To fhew then, that common fait itfclf, that fecms the moft primitive and fimple
amongft grofs and vifiblc falts, may be produced by a change of texture made in
bodies very differing from common fait, 1 fhall recite an experiment, which though
it have fomctimcs tailed me, yet it has divers times anfwered my defire, though I
fhall now relate but that finglc one of my laft trials, that fucceed belt
That, which our Englifh glaffmcn call ftindevery and the French, of whom probably
the name was borrowed, fuindtvir, and is, you know, that recrement, that is
made, when the materials of glafs, namely fand and a fixt lixiviate alkali, having
been firft baked together, aud then kept long in fufion, the mixture cafts up the fuperfluous
fait, which the workmen afterwards take off with ladles, and lay by as
little worth ; this fait feldom ulcd by mincralifts, and fcarce wont to be mentioned by
the writers of courfes of chymiftry, I have thought fit to employ about feveral purpofes,
invited thereto by confidering the ufual way, wherein it is produced. For in
fandever we have a fair, which was once altogether lixiviate, but which having been
kept long melted in a ftrong fire with fand (or flints or pebbles) muft have had its faline
corpufclcs varioufly and forcibly ground or nibbed againft one another, and againft
the particles of the fand, fome of which it may alfo have diflblvcd and retained with
it; by which rude juftlings and mutual attritions, I thought it very probable, that
the alkali muft not only have been confiderably altered, but varioufly too, fome parts
being changed more and after a differing manner than others, by which means fandever
may confift of portions differingly qualified both in reference to the lixiviate
fait, that was at firft employed, and to one another.
We took a pretty quantity of good fandever, and having diflblvcd it in fair water,
and filtred it, we fet it to evaporate in a digeftive furnace, till a faline cruft, as if it
were a thin plate of ice, fpread itfclf upon the top of the liquor; thrn fuffcring it to
cool and cryftallize, we broke the mentioned cover, to come at the cryftals, and li t
the liquor we had poured off from them to evaporate further and fhoct again : and
in this method we proceeded, whilft we judged worth while to do fo. By this means
we obtained good ftorc of cryftals, whole figures were not the fame, but many of
thern differing enough, though moft of them tranfparent and prettily fliaped, as if
nature had at one-." affected variety in their figuration, and yet confined hcrlelf to
geometrizc. But the chief thing, for which I mention this experiment, is, by this
way of proceeding, I more than once obtained (not on the very ItiffaVCC of the water,
as is ufual in the concretion of foa-falt) but in other parts, and chiefly beneath the

furface of the feline plate formerly mentioned, a confiderable number of grains of
felt, that better anfwered to the defcription of common felt, than diflblved and filtered
fea-felt itfelf is wont to do : for thelc grains, that were of no defpicable bignefs,
were as like little cubes or dice, as if they had been made by a fkilful jeweller •, and
their furfaces had a fmoothnefe and gloflinefs much furpafling whatever I had obferved
in marine or common felt.
I may confirm the difference, I have mentioned to be between fendever and common
alkalies, if I here add, that fome while ago having fet a good quantity of filtered
folution of fendever to coagulate in a cool place, and thereby brought a great part
of the felt to coagulate into cryftals, almoft like thofe of nitre, but lb very diaphanous,
that divers of them were clear as rock cryftal itfelf; I did not obferve them to
relent by the moifture of the air in a long time, though the glafs they were kept in
were negligently enough covered with paper only ; which argues their texture to have
been remote enough from that, which is proper to alkalies : and to fhew, that they
were alfo felts of a peculiar nature, I (hall further obferve, that if they were cxpofed,
though but to a gentle beat, they would in no long time lofe their tranfparency,
and be reduced to a white and fine calx ; which being weighed and re-diffolved
in water, and made again to cryftallize, would be diaphanous, and concoagulatc
with itfelf fo much of the water, as fufiked to give a very notable incrcafc of the
weight.
Sandever, which afforded me the firft of the two inftances I promifed you of the
production of felts, is one of thofc bodies, that many would reckon amongft thofe,
that are almoft mcerly artificial. I (hall now mention a fecond inftance of a body*
wherein art feems to have little to do, fave the eafy extrication of its particles from,
thofe, wherewith nature had blended it in a human body. If then man's urine, after
having been kept fome weeks in a doled vcffcl, be cxpofed to a moderate fire, firft
it will yield a fpirit and a volatile felt, and then a very copious phlegm, which being
totally exhaled, there will remain a dry caput mortuum ; and this being warily calcined,
diflclved in water, and coagulated, if the experiment iuccecd with you, as it
did with me, you will find the felt very different from a common lixiviate alkali*
rather you will find feline concretions of differing forms, if not kinds : for 1 obferved
feme to be oblong, and to look like fome cryftals of nitre •, others, to be of figures
refembling thofe, that geometricians call Rbcmluscs or Rbomhides •, and one of the
fairtft of thele lozenges, I remember, for trial-feke, I kept for many days expofed
to the air, and that in winter, without finding it run per deliquium, as a piece of common
alkali of that bignefs would have done in a little part of that time. But befides.
thofc numerous feline concretions, that I could not eafily reduce to any known figure,
there was (which 1 chiefly expeded, and would have you take notice of) a confiderable
number of fine grains, that looked like common fait, and were indeed more exactly
cubical in their figure, than the grains of fca-falt themlelves are wont to be. And I
have the lefs caule to doubr, that the fen fait abounding in our caput mortaum was net
a common lixiviate alkali, but coniirted of parts of other natures, efpccially of fuch
as compol'ed fea-lalt ; becaufe I obferved, that the caput mortuum, when cxpofed tc»
calcination, began early to melt Li the lire, before it was near calcined, as not am
aikali, but fea-falt, would have done ; alii) becaufe the talte was much nearer to that
of brine, than to that of lixivium •, and becaufe, lailly„ it would make no conflict
with the fpirit of felt, as an^alkali would have done, but did make of a folution of
filvcr in aquafortis a white precipitate, like that we make of that metal witfifca,felr„
but not with alkdies.
6o8 Tie PRODUCIBLENESS of
And becaufe a mifchance unfcafonably deprived me of the caput mortuum of domeftic
urine, prepared in my own laboratory, I was fain to procure a fupply of fixt
fait of urine made by a diligent Spagyrift of my acquaintance, who had wrought
much upon that liquor, and having diflblved and filtered a pretty quantity of this
fait, and fuffered the folution to evaporate flowly, till it began to have a flcin, I found
the cryftals it afforded in a cool place to be fome of them an inch or two long, and
(haped almoft like cryftals of nitre, fave that they were fharper at both ends, and to
many of them were faftened ftore of minute and oblong cryftals prettily fhaped,
which were placed almoft perpendicularly upon the greater proportions of fait, which
by this means obtained a fhape, not much unlike that, which the French engineers call
cbeval de frife : thefe cryftals, as they did not refcmble common alkalies in their
figures, fo they were unlike to them in divers other refpects. For though fome oil of
tartar >>fr dtliquium being poured upon fome of them, there enfued no manifeft commotion,
as is wont to be produced, when that liquor is mutt with a fait, where an
acid is predominant, yet being beaten and mixt with an acid lpirit, as that of common
fait, they made not the leaft ebullition or conflict, though they were (hired up and
down to excite it j nor did aqua fortis, good enough to be worthy of that name, produce
any hiding noife or froth, when it was put upon the fait of urine, though at
length it diflblved a good proportion of it. And though ftrong oil of vitriol being
put upon fome of the forementioncd cryftals, did readily work upon them, and in
corroding them excite a good number of bubbles, yet that did not furprile me, nor
make me conclude the fait to be alkalizatc, becaufe I have obferved oil of vitriol
(though not fpirit of fait or aqua fortis) to work after the like manner upon common
fait, of which that the fixt fait of urine did participate, I judge very probable,
partly upon the account of the phenomenon newly recited, partly becaufe I found,
that by impregnating good aqua fortis with a competent quantity of the fixt fait, inftead
of diflblving in it fea-falt, 1 could make it capable of corroding foliated gold,
even in the cold j and pardy alfo, becaufe that fome part of the folution of our fixt
thick and muddy, and foon after let fall a precipitate copious Enough : and another
part of the fame folution did readily precipitate filver diflblved in aqua fortis, but
would not fo much as difcolour a ftrong folution of fublimate (made in fair water)
from which a common lixiviate alkali would have immediately ftruck down an orangecoloured
powder.
A light fufpicion I once had, that the common fait, that moft men eat to feafon
their aliments, may in fome degree impregnate men's urine, gave me the curiofity to
examine that of horfes, which I found to require rather a fhorter than a longer putrefaction
than human urine, to make it fit for diftillation but the caput mortuum of
this alfo, I was by an accident hindered to examine ftifficiently : but by the fpirit
and volatile fait the liquor after putrefaction eafily afforded, it feemed probable
enough, that the fixt fait would have been not unlike that of men's urine. Of
which laft named olid and dcfpicable liquor I chofe to make an inftance in this place,
becaufe chymifts arc not wont to care for extracting the fixt fait of it (which is therefore
commonly prcfumed to be like other alkalies) but as foon as they have diftillcd
the faline fpirits, throw away all the reft as nothing wordi. Which practice, as
general as it i:, I cannot commend ; for though I am not altogether of Helmont's mind,
where he fays, that Wifdom defpifes tbefe, that defpife the indagotion of urin:, and refufe
by. thefire tofearcb out its contents ; yet I think, that thofe, who underftand the myflical
writings of fome of the beft chymical philofophcrs of former times, will look upon
it as a more tolerable hyperbole, than other men or even vulgar chymifts imagine it
to be.

Of the produOion of vinous fpitffs;
AS for what the chymifts call fpirit, they apply the name to fo many differing
things, that this various and ambiguous ufe of the word feems to me no mean
proof, that they have no clear and fettled notion of the thing. Moil of them are
indeed wont, in the general, to give the name of fpirit to any dirt il Jed volatile liquor,
that is not infipid, as is phlegm, or inflammable, as oil. But under this general
term they comprehend liquors, that are not only of a differing, but muft be,
according to their principles, of a quite contrary nature •, fome of them being acid,
as fpirit of nitre, of fait, and of vinegar itfelf ; and fome of them urinous, or, as
fome would have it, volatile alkalies, which are fuch enemies to the former, that,
as foon as they are put together in due proportions, they tumultuate and grow hot,
and ufually continue to fight, till they have difarmcd or mortified each other. Befides
thefe two hoftile families of fpirits, there is a third fort, which they call vinous
or inflammable, which though very fubtile and penetrant, is not manifeftly either
acid, or alkalizate •, I fay, manifeftly, becaulc the tafte and fmell of this fort of
fpirit is differing from both the forts laft named ; and yet is referred to one, or the
other of them, by fome learned Spagyrilts-, with whom I neither need, nor defire
to difpute about this matter ; fincc it may fuffice for my purpole, if it can be made
out, that all the three forts of fpirits above mentioned, the vinous or inflammable,
the urinous or alkalizate, and the acid, may be produced, and confequcntly may be
other than primeval bodies.
And to begin with the firft named, thefe vinous fpirits are fo producible by art,
that we feldom find them produced by nature alone, which does indeed make the juice
of grapes, but does not make wine, nor the fpirit of wine, unlefs, by the help of
man, that juice be preffed out, and fermented. And the cafe is yet more plain in
the ardent fpirits made of ale, beer, and in the like vinous fpirits made by the decoding
and fermenting the feeds and other parts of vegetables. And it is obfervablc
to our purpole, that muft (or the juice of grapes newly prcfled out) does not in
diftillation yield a vinous and inflammable fpirit. And I remember, I had once the
pleafure to laugh at a man, otherwife very ingenious, who, to catch the fubtile
vinous fpirit, that he would have me think was loft in the common way of handling
wort, made it work in a huge copper limbec, to catch the fpirituous parts, that he
thought would otherwife fly away •, by which means, inftead of the ardent fpirit he
' expected, he got nothing in his receiver but a naufeous phlegm. I have alio found
by trial, that ralfina (which we know are but dried grapes) being diftilled alone,
afforded an acid and empyrcumatical, but not a vinous fpirit i whereas, when I carc-
Vol. L 4 1 fully
6io He Produgibleness
fully fermented them with a due proportion of water, they would afford me in diflillation
an ardent fpirit like that of wine.
If it be objected, as I prcfume it will, that the vinous and inflammable fpirit, that
is by fermentation obtained from bodies, was actually in them before, and is only
extricated by fermentation ; I anfwer, that this is gratis di£Jumt and is therefore not
to be admitted till it be proved ; fince raifins, and fuch other fermentable bodies do
not, upon the fuppofed analyfis made by didillation, afford a vinous fpirit, but one
that is very differing from it. And I fee not, why the change of texture may not
turn fome part of the juice of grapes into a vinous and inflammable liquor, fince a
little further change is able to turn the fame juice into a liquor, that is acid, and
Hcithcr vinous nor inflammable, as it was before. And I have found by trial, that
even this vinegar, crude as it is, being fatiatcd with calx of lead made per fe> would
afford a fpirit not acid, but of a very differing taftc, and inflammable, like the fpirituous
parts of wine. And if it fhould be further objected, that thefe inflammable
fpirits were not produced by thefe operations, but prc-exiding in the newly expreffed
juice of grapes, were only extricated by fermentation, and being afterwards covered
ordifguued by the acid particles of the vinegar, were again extricated by diftillation,
the acid fcltt having fixt thcmfclves upon the lead they corroded, and thereby given
the fpirits leave to forfake them : if I fay, this be objected, I might refer you to a
more full anfwer, that I have clfcwhcre given. And at prefent it may ferve the turn,
that I put you in mind again, that the objection alleges no phsenomena to make appear
the actual pre-cxidence of vinous fpirits, either m the juice of grapes, or in the
folution of lead.
Amd though I need but deny what is barely affirmed, not proved •, yet to examine
this matter further than I had found others to have done, I did (as I elfewhere mention)
make afaccbarum Satitrni with an acid liquor made without fermentation, or the
addition of any liquor from wood itfelf •, and then, diddling it alfo without any additament,
I had (as I expected) a fpirit, that readily took fire and burnt away in a
blue flame, like that of fpirit of wine. 1 know another objection may be framed
from the doctrine of fome chymifts, who would have fpirit of wine to confift of the
oily parts of the juice of grapes rarefied and fubtilized. But with thefe learned men
(for fuch I know fome of them to be) I have not here any need to enter into a difpute
; fince, without examining, whedier their opinion be true or no, if it be admitted,
it will be confident enough with mine. For to fay, that by fubtiliation,
rarefactkin, a peculiar kind of commixture with the phlegm, or the like means, the
oil contained in the juice of grapes (and feparable from it, in the form of oil, if it
be diddled before it be fermented) becomes fpirit of wine, is but to aflign the modus,
whereby vinous fpirits are produced, but not to deny their production. And all that
my purpofe requires, is, that it be proved or granted, that inflammable fpirits arc
really produced, by what way foever they come to be fo. I fhall add, that though
experience witneffes, that honey being fkilfully fermented with a due proportion o£
-water, will yield a greater plenty of inflammable fpirit than the wine itfelf, that is
made in divers countries ; yet when we have carefully diddled honey before fermentation,
it afforded us a great proportion of confidcrably acid fpirit, that would diffolve
fome metals, but fo little od, that the paucity fcemcd drangc, and made it appear
unlikely enough, that fo inconfiderablc. a proportion of that liquor fhould be rarcjlable
into lb much ardent fpirit,. as may be obtained foora well fermented honey.

tc, foot of wood, &V. thst we have formerly called urinous, becauie of their
t affinity in many qualities to the more familiarly known liquor, fpirit of urine,
as for thefe, I know not, whether it will be neceflary to treat of their origin
apart ; fince, for aught experience has yet affurcd me, thefe fpirits are not fimple,
but compounded bodies, confining of the volatile fait of the concrete, that afforded
them, duTolved in the phlegm, and for the moft part accompanied with fome little
oil, at firft undifcerned by the eye, though afterwards it grow vifible. The preiencc
of this oil in moft fpirits, belonging to this family, may be probably argued from the
deep tincture, that in procefsof time, fpirit of hartfhorn; of blood, and divers other
fubje&s, will acquire by (landing, though prefently after their diftillation, and firft
br fecond rectification, they were clear, and colourlcfs as water-, the oily portion,
which, whilft it was in very minute particles, lay concealed in the mixture, becoming
difcovcrable in procefs of time by their extricating themfelvcs a little, and afl'ociating,
though not fo far as to emerge and float, yet far enough to difclofe themselves
by the colour they give the liquor. But in fpirit drawn by the help of an
alkali from fal armoniac, a concrete not abounding in oily parts, like hart/horn,
blood, i*c. kept not only for many months, but divers years, I obferved no fitch
difcolouration which was one inducement to make me, in fpeaking of the oleaginoufnefs
of urinous fpirits, to employ the word moft rather than the word
Havi no therefore hitherto by rectifications and digeftions obferved nothing in
thefe urinous fpirits but a cryftalline volatile fait, moft commonly feparable in a dryform,
and the phlegm it was diflblved in, befides fome oleaginous particles, that had
(though at firft unperccivedly) aflbciated thcmfclves to it ; I fee no great need to
trouble you with particular inftances about this fort of fpirituous liquors i what ha*
been faid making it allowable for me to refer you to what I deliver about the production
of falts, where that of volatile ones is mentioned.
SECT. III.
Of the production of acidfpirits
AS for acid fpirits, that fome of them may be generated or produced de novoy
feems probably deducible, partly from what has been already delivered (in the
firft part of thefe notes) concerning the production of acid falts ; and partly from
what will be ere long recited of acid, as well as of urinous and of vinous fpirits,
obtained by diftillation from one and the fame body. And if we take the word acid,
as I ufually do in thefe notes, in a familiar fenfe, without cryptically diftinguifhing
it, from thofc fapors, that are a-kin to it, perhaps the fpirit of fea-falt and that of
nitre may be fitly enough propofed, as inftances of the production of acid fpirits.
Fcr though fca-lalt and its diftilled liquor have upon fome bodies the like operations,
as either of them will precipitate lilver out of aqua fortis, yet not only the tafte of
the fpirit of fait (efpccially that which rifes laft in diftillation) is exceeding different
from that of crude fait, not only in ftrcngth and penetrancy, but in this, that the
4 I 2 fpirit
6l2 T'he pRODUCIBLEN E88
fpirit is highly acid. Whereas the crude fait has a tafte not properly acid, but that,
which by a diftinft name is in Latin commonly called falfus, iuch as that, which predominates
in brine ; and it does not appear, that this acid fturit did as fuch pre-cxilt
in the fait, whence it was obtained, fo that wc may fuppole it to have been made
rather by tranfmutation than extrication. And the like, I think, may (and that with
greater probability) be faid of the fpirit of nitre ; for though this be highly acid>
yet the nitre, that afforded it, is not at all fenfibly acid : and this new vehement tafte
of the fpirituous parts, as well as their great efficacy in duTolving metals, and divers
other bodies, feems to have been produced by the violent action of the fire (agreeably
Put i. 10 wnat * formerly noted) which by cleaving the nitrous corpufcles, or by rubbing
them one againft another, or by both thefe ways, and perhaps by fomc others, makes
a comminution of them into fragments or particles, which both becaufe of their
fmallncfs and lightnefs may be elevated by the adtion of the fire, and becaufe of the
fame minutenefs and their (harp and pointed figures may get into the pores of many
other bodies, and divide their parts. I know, thatchymifts may objeft, that all the
acid fpirit, that can be diftilled from nitre, was really pre-exiftcnt in it, and only
clogged and difguifed by the alkalizate ingredient, wherewith it was affociated, as may
appear by what I myfelf relate of the fpeedy way of making falt-petre, by putting
a due proportion of the fpirit of nitre to the alkali, or fixt part of nitre, that remains
after the falt-petre has been fulminated or burned. But to this I anfwer, that this
proves indeed (what I readily grant) that lalt-pctrc may be artificially compounded of
a nitrous fpirit and a fixt alkali, but does not prove, that nature does always, or fo
much as ordinarily produce nicrc by the fame ways,, that is, by compounding it of.
the fame ingredients. For it does not appear, that wherever falt-petre is generated..
in the earth, nature has before-hand laid in a provifion of lixiviate fait, which (at
leaft, in thefe countries) is not wont to be made without the violence of an incinerating
fire and of corrofive fpirits, to obtain which, or either of themr artifts are
fain to employ vehement fires ; whereas it feems, that falt-petre is flowly generated
in the earth by gradual or fucceflive alterations of fome idoneous matter, wherein,,
for aught I have obferved, not an acid, but an urinous fait is predominant-, as may
be made probable by what 1 have formerly related about earth, that had long lain,
covcreil with pigeons-dung in a dove-houfe, which I found in diftillation to yield a.
volatile fpirit and fait, much like thofe of urine. Therefore I will not affirm, that
nature does never employ fixt alkalies and acid fpirits to make falt-petre ; yet I fee
not, that chymills have hitherto given us, or perhaps offered us any cogent proof,
that (he muft neccffarily do fb» 1 further obferve this more confiderable argument,
that, according to what I formerly noted, falt-pctrc diftilled in clofe vcflcls afforded
us but an inconfiderablc quantity of fixt fait, and that too was but a very imperfect
alkali ; though the quantity of nitrous fpirit was great enough to perfuade us, that
not any thing near fo much as was wanting of the entire weight of the falt-petre
had palled into the receiver. And clfewherc I relate, that a friend of mine, with the
help of a peculiar clay, obtained near a pound of fpirit of nitre from a pound of
falt-petre whereas, on the other fide, by a differing way of managing it, and without
additament, I obtained, as I there relate, about ten ounces of fixt nitre from a
pound of falt-petre. Whence it feems probable, that the fame iubftance, that in
crude nitre is almoft infipid, may by an operation of the fire be diftilled into a highly
acid fpirit, as well as, by another operation and way of management, be brought
into the nature of a fixt and cauftic alkali. It may alio be worth conlidering, whether,
the fpirits of nitre theml'elvcs, when after being made jus juris they compofe a

diftinfr. liquor, and arc fpecificated, may not be deprived of their acid nature, and
may become, or at leaft materially concur to make up, a fixt alkali. For if 1<afalt,
which chymifts do not pretend to contain any fuch alkali, be thoroughly difFolved
in a fufficient quantity of fpirit of nitre, and impregnated, this compounded fait will,
as I have formerly noted, yield a confiderable proportion of fixt alkali like that of
lalt-pctre, which is as likely to proceed from the nitrous, as from the marine part of
the relulting fait ; and if it do, it will make it the more probable, that it is not neccllary,
that the faline corpufcles of fpirit of nitre lhould be primordial bodies, fince
they may be deftroyed or turned into other falts •, which is not lefs repugnant to the
nature of a principle, than it is to be de novo producible from a body, that was not
acid before.
SECT. IV.
"¥ T may add much probability to what has been above difcourfed, concerning the
| produciblcnefs of the differing forts of fpirits, if it (hall appear, that the fame
body, meerly by different ways of ordering it, may be eafily enough brought to afibrd,
either acid, or inflammable, or volatile, commonly called urinous fpirits, as the Ikiliul
ax-tilt plcafrs.
An inllance of this may be afforded us by fome legiimens, as peas, or beans
;
which if they be newly gathered and diftilled in a retort, it will, I prcfume, be eafily
granted, that they will, like many other green vegetables, afford, befides a great
deal of phlegm, an acid fpirit •, and if I much mil-remember nor, I had fuch a fpirit
from either peas, or beans, or both, after they had been kept long enough to lofe
their verdure. But if thefc feeds be at a fit time duly fermented with common
water, I think it will not be doubted, but that they, as well as other mealy feeds, will
yield an ardent fpirit -, but it will not fo eafily be fufpected, much lefs believed, that
without adding any thing to them, or meddling with them, barely by keeping them
in a dry place, for a certain number of months, they will yield a fpirit, that by one,
that did not know whence it proceeded, would be judged near of kin to the fpirit
of urine, or of hartlhorn, and to other faline liquors drawn from animal fubftances.
For having diftilled thefc legumcns by themfclves, without any additament, and
without fo much as breaking them, they afford me fpirits, not only far more like in
fmcll to thole, I have compared them to, than they were either to acid, or vinous
fpirits, but very like them, in more intimate qualities ; fince they would, as the fpirit
of urine and hartlhorn, make a conflict with acid fpirits, turn fyrup of violets green,
diffolve copper blue, precipitate a folution of fublimate into a white fubftance ; and
in a word, perform thofe things, w hich I many years ago delivered in the traft about
colours, and fevcral ingenious writers have fince embraced, as the diftinguilbing
marks of volatile and urinous falts, or fpirits. I fay falts or fpirits, becaufe I found
that thefc drawn from vegetables, as well as thofe afforded by animals, may eafily by a
dexterous fublimation be brought to exhibit many of their nobler parts in the form
of a dry fait, as well as in that of a fpirituous liquor.
Another inllance I fhall take from the juice of grapes, though chymifts will perhnps
think it ftrangc, that I lhould undertake to accommo-la e it to my prefent purpole
; but there is no great myltcry in the bufinef, : for the frefh juice cf grapes or
mult, though fweet in t.ifte, will, if it be timely diftilled to the confiftence almoft of
a fyrup, yield a copious phlegm, but net an ardent fpiril : if the fupcrfiiiovi5 moifture

for an excellent ingredient of fauces, and abb, to be tprcad upon bread to be eaten
inftead or" butter.
But if this raifinee or fapa were prefently diftillcd, I fuppofe it would yiekl no
vinous, but an acid fpirit : I faid, I fuppofe, becaufc for want of vineyards in E»g-
Lvni, I could not examine any liquor taken out of great veficls of muflj, and diercfore
cannot fay prccifely and experimentally, what diddled liquors it would afford
;
fince I know not certainly, whether the great quantity of the fweet liquor, and its
continuance for fome time (though not a long one) in the (late of what they call muft,
may not fomewhat alter its productions, but if, as it is probable, that diverGty be not
confidcrable, I may fafciy fuppofe, that the vinous fpirit afforded by the juice of
grapes, after fermentation has turned it into wine, is a produced thing, and was not
in that form prc-cxiftent in the juice -
t for having purpofcly caufed ripe grapes to be
moderately preffed, that their juice may, v/ithout much dreggy matter, be fqucezed
out, we put this liquor intoaglafc head and body, and diftilling it with a gentle fire,
we obtained a fcarce credible proportion of phlegm : and then transferring the fomewhat
infpilTated remainder into a retort, after having kept lbme of it (which had a
grateful mixture of fwcetnefs and acidity) for raifinee, we profecuted the diilillation
with a ftronger fire, and obtained not a vinous, but an acid fpirit, as we found, not
only by its Imcll and tafte, but by its corroding fragments of coral, even in the cold,
by its growing fweet upon minium, &c. Agreeably to which experiment, I found
by trial, that raifins, which confift chiefly of the juice of grapes, infpiflated in the
fkins or hu(ks by the avolition of the fuperfluous moifture through their pores, being
diftillcd in a retort, did not afford any vinous, but rather an acetous fpirit, that, as
an acid liquor, would work upon divers bodies, as fpirit of vinegar would have done,
and yet, as it was formerly noted, it is known, that raifins being in a due proportion
fermented with common water, will, after a certain time, afford a vinous and inebriating
liquor and though this time in the better fort of the known ways, of making
artificial wines, is wont to amount to many months, yet I have pra&ifcd a way
(which confifts chiefly in a determinate proportion of the water to the raifins) by the
help of which, the liquor in very few weeks becomes fit to drink, and confequently
to afford by diftillation a vinous lpirit , but this only upon the by.
I shall now add, which probably you will think fomewhat llrangc, that from the
juice of grapes even after it has been duly fermented, there may be obtained a diftillcd
liquor, which having not found mentioned in authors, I thought, that I might take
the liberty to name, and upon the account of its tafte, and fome other qualities, to
call it the acid fpirit of wine : to fatisfy you therefore, that there is fuch a liquor, I
will not make ulc of Rhenifh wine or other wines, that are thought to relifli of acidity,
but I will acquaint you with an experiment, that I chofe to make upon lack,
as a wine fully ripe, and more remote from an acid and tartarous nature, than thofe
are wont to be, that are made in lefs hot climates. We took then fome good fack,
and having a digeftive furnace, and in a glafs-head and body, (lowly drawn off the
ardent fpirit firft, and then the phlegm (which even in this generous wine was copious)
till there remained a liquor of the confidence of a fomewhat thin fyrup. we
removed it into a retort, and diftilled it by degrees of fire, whereby we obtained,
befides a fourilh phlegm, that came firft over, a true acid fpirit, as appeared not only
by the tafte, but by the hilling noifc and numerous bubbles, that were produced,
when we poured it upon a lixiviate fait •, as alto by this, that having put it upon
powdered corals, it began brifixly to diflblvc them, even in the cold : we likcwife

made it corrode ibme metalline, and mineral bodies, of which it is not here ntccflary
to give you an account, no more than of the black fubftance, that remained after
the diftillation : only two tilings I will here intimate about them : the one, that as.
this acid fpirit of wine has its origination differing from that of other known acid
fpirits, and even from fpirit of vinegar, fo I thought it not irrational to conje&iire,
that it might have Tome peculiar qualities, whofc dilcovcry 1 leave you (if you think
it worth the whilej to prolecute : only by way of encouragement, as well as hint, I
fliall tell you, that having put Come of it, for a certain reafbn, upon filings of copper,
in fuch manner, that lome of them, after being wetted with the fpirit, ftiould remain
expofed to the air, and others lie beneath the liquor, I found, though the trials were
made in the cold, that in a day or two the expofed filings had gained a fine bluifhgrccn
colour, but the fpirit, that fwam upon the other filings, did in few hours acquire
a fine rednefs, which afterwards in two or three days degenerated into a colour
like that of the expofed filings. The other thing I will note, relates to the caput
mortuum of the diitillcd wine, which I found a more hxt body than one would have
expedled, and it is, that though probably the finer part belonging as to other vegetable
mixts, fo to the juice of grapes, being attenuated and fubtilized, was changed
into an ardent fpirit, and therefore appeared not in the diftillation, in the form of
oil, yet it is not unlikely, that the coarfcr part of the oleaginous fubftance remained
ftill in the caput mertuum : for holding it in the flame of a candle, I obferved, that ic
would partly exhale in thick linoke, partly melt, and as it were fry, and partly burn
with an actual flame, which was not only continued, while the flame of the candle
cheriftied ir, but would af ter it was removed from the candle, continue a pretty while
to flame upon its own account, and a parcel of it being caft upon quick (but not upon
flaming) coals, burned with a blaze, almoft as if it had been amber, or bitumen. I
could here tell you of fine cryftals of wine, that I many years fince made by a peculiar
way, of the above mentioned extract of fack but this may be clfcwhcre more
fitly mentioned.
To return therefore to our juice of grapes, we fee, that mccrly by a fcemingly
flight difference in the management of it, it may be made to afford either a vinous,,
or acid fpirit ; and I fliall now add, that it may alfo be brought to yield a volatile or
urinous one; for it is known, that in procefs of time, wine affords tartar-, and
though chymifts fuppofe the fpirit of tartar to be of a quite differing nature from that
of urine and of foot, and though I have elfewherc ftiewn, that tartar diftilled the
common way affords a double fpirir, namely, an acid, and another, that I thought
fit to call anonymous •, yet I ellewhere Ihow, that by a peculiar and flow way of operating,
I have been able to obtain (though perhaps not conftantly) from crude tartar
without any additament, a fpirituous fubftance, that in tafte, fmell, and divers mani^
feft operations, much more refembled the volatile fpirit of urine, or rather that of
foot, obtained as mine of tartar was, by meer diftillation, than an acid fpirit : with
which (fo little did they agree) it was dilpefed to make a coiiflidr. as foon as they were
put together. But fuch a kind of volatile fubftance may be far more eafily obtained
from the lees of wine, than from tartar ; for having been accidentally informed, that
an expert chymift in Germany had found the way to get ftore of volatile fait from lee*
of wine, I refolvcd to try, whether it might not be done without any addition-, and
having procured fome of the beft lees (I could get) of Rhenifh wine, I cauled them
to be expotid in broad veflels to the fun, and the free air (which circumftancc yet I air*
not fi.re is neccflary) that they might Icilurcly be dried, if not alio be impregnate!*

diftilled in a retort by degrees of fire, the liquor was flowly rectified, by which means
there afcended before the phelgm a fpirituous part, which would turn fyrup of violets
green, precipitate diffolved fublimate into a white powder, foon colour itfelf upon
copper with a deep blue, and in Ihort dofeveral things, by the performance of which
we have elfewhcrc diftinguifhed volatile falts and fpirits from acid and from vinous
ones. By all fuch trials upon the juice of grapes, we may infer the truth, we intended
to prove by them, namely, that the lame matter, as it is differingly managed,
may be made to afford an acid (befides one, that is truly acetous) a vinous, and a
volatile fpirit : befides that, ex abundantly it may alio be made to yield, as I have
noted in mentioning the diftillation of tartar, another fort of fpirituous jubilance, as
yet anonymous.
New obfervations about the adiapboroui fpirits of Woods and divers other bodies.
AND now having fallen upon the mentioning of this fort of fpirits, that I have
called anonymous, fince I remember not that the notice I gave the public of
them * has engaged any writer to examine them •, I am content on this occafion to
touch upon fomc of the more quick and cafy trials, that I have made about this kind
of liquors, that I may both excite and fomewhat affift the curiofity of thole enquirers,
that lhall attempt to make a farther difcovery of the nature of thefe fpirits j
which when I firfi leparatcd from the acid fpirits, wherewith chymifts had before confounded
them, as ftyling them, and taking them to be meerly the acid fpirits of
tartar, wood, t£c. their properties were fo little known to me, that I contented myfelf
to ftyle them anonymous fpirits : but fince having found them to differ in divers
qualities, both from vinous, from acid, and from urinous ones, and having not
fufficiently difcovcrcd their pofitive properties, I was wont to give them a negative
appellation, and call each of them the neutral or adiaphorous fpirit of the body,
that affords it, (whether it be tartar, wood, or any other like concrete.)
But before I defcend to particulars, it will not be improper to prcmifc in general
three or four things not unfit to make way for the obfervations, that are to
follow them.
I. I know not, whether it will be requifite to repeat in the firft place, that our
adiaphorous fpirit may be obtained by diftilling the liquor, that is afforded by woods
and divers other bodies ; by diftilling this liquor, I fay, from corals, or calcined
lead ; for by this means the acid corpufcles of the menftruum will work upon the
coral or the lead, and fo fallen themfelves to what they corrode, that they will eafily
enough part with the adiaphorous fpirits, which by this means are permitted to afcend
by themfelves and fall into the receiver, in the form of a liquor. This, as 1 was
faying, [ know not, whether it be neccfiary to infill on in this place, becaufe 1 have
already mentioned it in another paper : but 1 think it may be very pertinent to relate
here, that I endeavoured to try, whether there was not a difference in gravity or
fixednefs between the acid and neutral fpirit of wood, without mortifying the firft j
and whether by the help of this gravity and fixednefs, I might not be able to feparate,
at lealt in great part, the acid from the other, and fo preferve it in its diftinift
nature.
In order to tin's, I caufird a pretty quantity of the rectified fpirit of box to be
flowly dilhlled in a glals body and head, placed in a land cupel with the flame of a
* This wis done in ihc S.rptical Chjaijt.

Part II. of Spirits.
lamp, as that, which would give a more gentle and regular heat than charcoal ; as
indeed in the firft twenty-four hours or thereabouts, this furnace afforded but about
two fpoonfuls of liquor ; and though the menftruum firft put in fcarce exceeded, by
our guefs, one pint or pound (if it were fo much) yet it was divers days and nights
in drawing over. And in this operation the molt obfervable circumftances were thefe
two : Fine, that the liquor, that firft aicended, was not phlegm, but had a very
penetrant tafte, yet without any manifeft acidity, difcovcrable by the tongue, though
by putting it upon fine powder of coral ^whether crude or calcined I remember not)
it had ibme operation, that made me think it not altogether devoid of acid particles.
Secondly, having often fhifted the receiver, the better to judge, whether the portions
of the afcending fpirit were confiderably different in quantity, I found that, towards
the latter end, the liquor, that came over, was {harper than before , and having, at
length, diftilled all I could make to arife, wc found the laft parcel of liquor (which
was copious enough) to be of a good yellow colour (though thofe that preceded it
were limpid enough) and both to fmell ftrong of vinegar, and to tafte more acid upon
the tongue than ipirit of common vinegar iuelf : fo that if I had not known, how it
was obtained, 1 had fufpccled it to be what the chymifts call acetum radicatum ; and
accordingly I found it to be a very active menftruum in the diflblution of fome
bodies, mat, for trial-fake, were put into it. All which feems to argue, that the
acid portion of fuch diftilled liquors, as I have been fpeaking of, is more ponderous,
or more fixt, than the adiaphorous fpirit, which, upon this account, may be in great
part feparated from it by bare diftillation, if it be warily enough made.
My fecond general remark (hall be, that I have obferved thefc neutral fpirits
to be not all of them, in all things, of the fame nature } fince though they
agree in fome general attributes, which fuifice to entitle them to the fame fpecics
or denomination, yet they fometimes differ from one another in particular
qualities : which advertifement I thought it neceffary to premife, that it may
not fcem ftrange, and that 1 may not be blamed, though fome of the trials I fhall fet
down do not punctually fucceed in their hands, that ftiall not make ufe of the anonymous
fpirit or box, which I employed •, not becaufe 1 think it better than any other,
but becaufe amongft divers, that I have made ufe of, I had then a greater quantity
of it at hand. But though tor this reafon, when 1 fhall fpeak what I have obferved
in an adiaphorous fpirit, without naming it, I would be underftood of the fpirit of
box, which I had freed from its acid mixture by diftilling it from calcined coral ; yet
I fhall not fo confine myfelf to this, as not to mention, now and then, fome odief
fpirit of the fame family.
The third general obfervation, that I fhall make about our adiaphorous fpirits, is,
that though the new chymifts, that have taken any notice of the diftilled liquors, for
example, of woods, were wont, by reafon of their acid taftes to look upon them, as
of a merely acetous nature, and having accordingly called them the vinegars or
acetous fpirits of wood, yet really the acid portion of thefe diftilled liqu>rs is far
from being thegreateft : for befides what other trials I have purpofely mat'e, I remember
[took eight ounces of the rectified fpirit of box, wherein the acetous and
neutral fpirit remained confounded, as they had been in the firft diftillation ; and
having poured this upon a quantity of calcined coral, fufficicnt to fatiatc the acid
corpufcles (which quickly fell to corrode it with noife and bubbles) wc gently diftilled
it to a drynefs in a glafs head and body, by which means we obtained of adiaphorous
fpirit but eight grains lefs than feven ounces and an halt, and fome of the menftruum
having been wafted in the operation, the acid corpufcles remaining in the bottom,
Vol. I. 4 K with
6i8 Tie PRODUCIBLENESS
with the coral they had corroded, weighed but between two and three drachms;
which (hews, that notwithftanding the not contemptible quantity of ftrong fpirit of
vinegar, that by our lately recited obfervation the diftilled liquors of box does contain,
the corpufcles, that make it fo acid, being concentred, take up but a little room.
And fince it was rational to fufpect, that the acetous corpufcles being made without
fermentation, might have fomcthing peculiar in their nature, I caufed them to be
gradually diftilled with a ftrong fire from the coral, and thereby obtained a very red
fpirit, of which, though many chymifts would take it for a volatile tindlureof coral,
1 fhall only obferve, that its fmell was very ftrong, and its tafte exceeding penetrant*
but very differing from that of acid liquors.
Whether our adiaphorous fpirit may (as I fomctimes fufpeded it may) be generated,
by a commixture of the finer parts of the oil of the wood reduced to an extraordinary
fmallnefs, and thereby capable of being exquifitely mixt with the phlegm,
and ftri&ly aflbciated with its particles, I fhall ftay, till I be better furniihed with experiments,
before I venture to determine.
Having premifed the foregoing general obfervations, I fhall proceed to particular
ones, as foon as I fhall have advertifed you, that for the better difcerning the phenomena
to be produced, I chofe to make almoft all the following trials in cylindrical
glaffts of about an inch in diameter.
To the phenomenon I am about to take notice of, I therefore give the firft place,
amongft thofc produced by the help of our adiaphorous fpirit, becaufe it is uncommon,
and not unpleafant : for though we have many experiments of the fudden tranfmutation
of colours, whereby we change one into another} yet we have very few of the
Cduftion of colours de novo, in bodies, that were colourlcfs before. And I remenv
not, that the writers I have fince met with, have added any experiments of this
kind to thofc three or four, that I have mentioned in the hiftory of colours.
1. I shall begin then with obferving, that having into our adiaphorous fpirit of
box dropt a convenient quantity of ftrong and tranfparent oil of vitriol, and fhaking

much more dark and mufcadine-likc than before.

more of this trial I muft not omit, which is, that notwithftanding the
ilrong and offenfive fmell, that is wont to be juftly complained of in aqua fortis, in
our mixture it was either none, or but very faint, being concealed (if I may fo fpeak)
or fupprelfed, and partly perhaps difguifed by the predominant odour of the adiaphorous
fpirit.

kept it there for many hours, it acquired a colour high enough, partaking of brown
and yellow, and appeared to have let fall fome little lediment to the bottom of the
glais.

fcnfible operation on it that we took notice of, lave that it diflblvcd the fait ; and,
after fome digeftion, appeared of a yellow colour tending to brown, and i aliened to
the infide of the phial in many little grains of fait, that feemed to have been firft
diffolvcd, and then coagulated again in newly-emergent figures.
5. Our adiaphorous liquor being confounded with high rectified fpirit of wine,
neither of them appeared to change colour much (for fome change there was towards
yellowness) or be opacated by their conjunction, even after fome days digefting ; but
the vinous fpirit did not hinder the other from being turned red by the action of fome
potent acid, when it was poured on the mixture.
6. Rectified fpirit ot urine being put to our adiaphorous liquor did not make
any conflict with it, but joined with it quietly, as the above mentioned fpirits had
done, and did not manifeftly change the colour of either of the liquors, whilft they
were kept many hours in the cold ; hut being transferred into a digeftive furnace,
and kept there a night or two, the liquor acquired a high colour, which was almoft
orange-brown, and there appeared fome little faeces at the bottom. Having made
thefe trials upon our fpirit with fimple liquors, I thought fit to make fome with fuch
compounded liquors, as the folution of metals are, to fee if our fpirit, though neither
manifeftly of an acid, or an urinous, or a lixiviate nature, would procure precipitations
of any part of the diflblvcd metals.
7. In profecuting this enquiry, I dropt into fome of our fpirit a little folution of
refined gold, which at firft imparted thereto its own colour (perhaps fomewhat
heightened) but the mixture quickly loft its tranfparency and grew muddy, and, after
a while, let fall a confiderable quantity of fediment or precipitate, the fupernatant
liquor having acquired a brownifh colour.

made in aquafortis, the colour of the mixture became firft deeply yellow, and
in a minute or two intenfely red -, and being digefted for fome days, I found at the
bottom of the phial a white precipitate, much more copious than I expected, and the

of which experiments were not always the fame with thofe above recited, which may

the more fixt acetous fpirit came to afcend, and having purpofely expofed a phial

THOSE fubftances, that chymitts are wont to call the fulphurs of the mixr

from a mixt body, by the intervention of the fire, appears in the form of an oil,
that will not mingle with water fomctimcs in the form of an ardent fpirit, that will
readily unite with that liquor j and fometimes alfo in the form of a confident body,
almoft like common fulphur.
Notwithstanding thcfe various forms, in which it appears, it is not impoflible,
but that in many mixt bodies, not to fay in all, what is called fulphur may be no
primordial ingredient, but rather a generated or refulting thing. For that, which is
common to thefe differing bodies, that pafs under the name of fulphurs, and which
.is the conftituent quality (if I may fo call it) that difcriminates them from the other
material principles of mixt bodies, mult be confeffed, if we will fpeak intelligibly,
to be inflammability, or, if you pleafe a difpofition to be turned into fire, and ufually
alfo into flame. "Which being premifed I confider here, that fulphur itfclf is made of
the fame univerial matter, whereof other bodies confift, and is but a coalition of
certain particles thereof, whole aggregate, by having fuch a contexture, motion, fcfr.
acquires thofe properties, for which a body is called fulphur. And therefore if the
like contexture happen to be found in other portions of matter, or (to exprefs rhyllelf
more fully) it art, or chance can frame and bring together particles of matter,
and give them fuch a contexture as is apt and fufficient to difpofe them to be kindled
and flame or burn away \ thcfe qualifications of fuch an aggregate of corpufcles will
fufficc to confer on it the nature of a fulphur, whether this portion of matter do, or
do not conGft, or copioufly participate, of the chymifts primeval fulphur. For it is
not by virtue of the long preceding duration of a thing, but by that of the eflential
qualities belonging to ir, that a body deferves this or that denomination. As the
fiiow, that fell ycftcrday, and was generated in a trice, is as true fnow, as that,
which has lain, perhaps for many years, on thofe Alpsy that are always covered with
fnow, or on the higheft mountains of the frigid zone. And in the judgment of the
chymifts themfelvcs, a pound of quickfilver recently tranfmuted by a grain or two
of their elixir into gold becomes as true gold, as that, which was coeval with the
mountains, where nature has formed the anticnteft mines of that metal.
S E C T I.
Of the produBion of oils.
THAT it is not ncceflary, the oils, or fulphurs obtained by the fire- from mixt
bodies, fliould be a primeval element or principle, may be probably argued
from the experimenr mentioned in the Sceptical Cbymift about the growth of plants
nourilhed by meer water, which neverthclels, by diftillation, afforded an oil. And
we fee, that in almond trees, walnut trees, and divers others, the rain water, that
infinuates itfelf into their roots, is, by fucceflive changes of texture, reduced into
the oil, which the fruit by expreflion fo plentifully affords. And to confirm our expcriment
from the growth or plants by tranfmuted or aflimilatcd water, to obviate
the fufpicion of common water's being impregnated with the grofler juices of the
earth, I employed diftillcd water. About which experiment I find this Jhort .memorial
among my adverfaria.
[A Sprig of mint put into rain-water, diftilled, and fed almoft 'wholly with redilhlled
rain-water, weighed July 15. gr. 3. and was taken out Augujl the 14th, and
being well dried with paper and a cloth, weighed 10 grains and about a quarter : fo
that within lefc than a month it grew to be three times as heavy, as when it was firft

within lefs than a month to near four times its firft weight, and had fhot out a
fecond fprig much higher than the firft, and ftore of roots, fomc of them near as long
again as the whole plant, when it was firft put in.]
Ir we confider, what a great quantity of oil is afforded by an olive-yard, whole
trees are probably, as well as thofc that bear apples, cherries, and other kinds of
aqueous fruits, nourifhed chiefly by rain-water, that being imbibed by the roots is
by various digeftions, or preparatory changes, turned into oil in the olive, it will not
appear unlikely, that oil may be produced of other fubftances : fince in our inftance
jt feems to have been made by tranfmutation of water, though this be generally reputed
to be of all liquors the moft contrary to it, and is evidently of a nature exceeding
diftant from it.
And here I (hall relate an experiment, by which I attempted to produce it, out of
only two diftilled liquors, that according to the common eftimation of chymifts are
uncompounded bodies , and, whether they be really fo or not, are each of them
jcadily diflblvable in water, and in one another. Take then of oil of vitriol, and of
iuch ipirit of wine, as is totally inflammable, an equal weight , mix them together
hy degrees, left the heat they will produce fhould breed lome inconvenience, and
having digefted them a good while (which yet is not abfolutely necefTary) with a very
wary management of the fire (for elfe the experiment will cafily mifcarry) draw off
what will come over : and if you go to work, as I have feveral times done, you fhall
obtain, bolides a fubtile and odoriferous fpirit of wine and an acid fulphureous liquor,
a confidcrable quantity of chymicaT oil, which i have had fbmetimes deeph/
coloured, fometimes clear like fair water: and this oil you will perchance look on
as an odd liquor, when 1 tell you, that I have had it, fometimes exceeding fragrant,
and (though the oil of vitriol be fo highly corrofive) without any acidity at all, the
jaftc of it being very fubtile and penetrant, but no way like that of any faline liquor,
that we know. This hath fometimes inticcd me to doubt, whether it hath
l«*cn nude of the fpirit of wine, or of the oil of vitriol. The circumftances laft
.mentioned fcem to perluade the former •, efpecially if I add to them, that I found by
trial purpofely made, that this oil would readily mix with good fpirit of wine, that
had never had to do with oil of vitriol ; but on the other fide it feemed conflderable
that the oil of vitriol by this operation was much weakened and changed, and it appeared
not, whence the fpirit of wine fhould have fo great a fragrancy ; which conliderations
were backed "by this more weighty argument, that this oil was fo ponderous,
as to fink ao: only in common water, which is yet a far more heavy liquor than
pure fpirit of wjne, but in the acid fpirit itfelf, which feemed to be the remains of
the altered oil of vitriol, which, by reafon of its abounding in fait, you will eafily
grant to be far heavier thaji common water. But I need not much trouble myfelf, to
.determine, which it is of the two liquors, that affords this ftrong oil ; for it may
well be (though not equally) compolcd of both, by their mutual action, and the
.operation of the fire, united in the form of oil. And if it be objected, as probably
.it will, that this inflammable fubftance is made but by extrication of the pans, that
Jay concealed in the liquors before they were brought together, it may be anfwered,
.that this (hould not be fuppofed, but proved ; which till it be, our caufe will be favoured
by our experiment, wherein there appears nothing fo likely as a chance of
rtexture ; to which may be afcribed the production of our anomalous chymicaT oil

of ours, being fhaken with water, would break, like common oils, into numerous
little globules ; which would presently after fink to the bottom, and re-unke there
into a liquor, which for trial-fake I have kept divers weeks in the water, and found
it at laft undiflblved by it. Some odd properties of this oil make it fecm likely to
participate of fome of the nobler parts of vitriol, and the fulphur of that metal having
extraordinary virtues afcribed to it, by fome of die famoufeft and intelligenteft
Spagyrifts (as Bafilius VaUntiust Helmont, &c.) 1 kept fome quantity of this oil by
me for leveral years, to obferve, as I did with pleafure, the alterations, that time
would produce in it, and afterwards I imparted either fome of the medicine itfclf,
(whereof the firft trial proved very fuccefsful) or the ways of preparing it, or. bothy
to fome ingenious men, who (I am told) did not all of them remember me in the freemention
they made of it.
But this concerns not our argument,, upon occafion whereof I (ball obferve upon
the by, that though chymifts ftiould be able to prove, that our oil was but feparated
from the fpirit of wine, or the oil of vitriol, in which it was latent before, yet ftill
the experiment would afford mc a confide rablc reafon for queftioning a main point in
the doctrine of the vulgar chymifts, who confidently pretend to prove from the
number of fimilar fubftanccs (as they fuppofe them) obtained from a mixt body, that
it was actually compounded of juft fo many diftinct and true material principles,
and fuch a quantity of each. For if from a diftilled liquor, as the oil or rather ponderous
and acid fpirit of vitriol, or from alcohol of wine, which is commonly reputed
to be uncompounded, a liquor of quite another kind may be (not made but) feparated,
how litde reafon have we, to take it for granted with the chymifts, that
every diftilled liquor, that they look upon as one of the component principles of the
body, that afforded it, is a homogeneous fubftance not further divifible into differing
parts?

Hie PfcODUCIBLENESS
Che moft intelligible, and lead indefinite notion their writings fuggeft of fulphur, is,
that it is a combuftible and inflammable principle ; I have hitherto treated of it as
fuch. Arid as for that fulphur, that is commonly known by that name, and bought
in (hops, though I know there are fome chymifts, that have affirmed, that from vegetables
and animals they can feparate fuch a fulphur , yet fince they are not wont to
teach us the way of doing it, nor give us any proofs, be fides their own word, of their
having ever done it themfelves, the thing has feemed fo improbable, that I find few
or none of the more judicious of their own party, that look upon it, as other than a
brag : only a follower of Glauber 1 find to have undertaken, by his mailer's directions,
to produce a real fulphur, like the mineral, out of vegetable charcoal, by a
way, which, becaufe it has deceived more than him, and is fpecious enough to impofe
upon thofe, that either are not chymifts, or, if they be chymiits, are not cautious
men, I fhall here fet down, and examine, as after the author I made it.
We took then equal quantities (fuppofe a pound of each) of good oil of vitriol
and of common fea-falt, difiblved in as much water as was requifite : this mixture
was flowly diftilled, till the bottom was throughly dry (which it wUl not be fo foon as
it begins to look white, or appear coagulated) then letting afide the liquor (whereof
the firft part that came over was phlegm, and the other part fpirit of fait) we took
out the caput mortuum (which, if one pleafes, may be purified by being diflblved and
philtered) and having beat it to powder with about one fourth or one eighth part of its
height of charcoal, wc put it in a ftrong crucible, and kept the mixture melted in a
vehement fire, till it grew of a dark reddifh colour, for by that time fuch a change
was made in the mafs, that it both fmelt and tailed rankly enough of fulphur ; and if
fpirit of fal armoniac were feafonably diftilled from it, with a competent, but not
over-hafty fire, the afcending fpirit would be manifeflly impregnated with fulphur not
difficultly feparablc, which may alfo be divers other ways obtained from the fame
fixt caput mortuum.
But for all this fpecious operation, I do not take the fulphur, thus produced, to
have been the vegetable fulphur of charcoal, but a mineral fulphur, that lay concealed
in a liquid form among the faline parts of the oil of vitriol.
For, firft, it is not likely, that fb fmall a quantity of charcoal, as was employed
in this experiment, and much lefs that fo fmall a quantity, as may fufficc to make
it, could contain fo much fulphur, as may this way be obtained.
Kext, that common vitriol is not deftitutc of mineral fulphur, may be eafily conjectured
by the fulphureoufnefs of the marchafites, whereof it is wont to be made,
jn fo much that in divers countries, as about Liege, and in fome parts of Italy, from
the fame fubftance, that affords them vitriol, they obtain by fublimation great quantities
of common fulphur, which is fold for fuch into divers other countries. And
I have found by trial, and do not at all think myfelf in that fingular, that one may
obtain from vitriol an oil, and a caput mortuum, which being put together, afforded a
jmell of common fulphur fo ftrong, that 1 was fcarce able to indure it.
And to come yet more clofe to our experiment, I have (as I have elfewhere mentioned)
purpofely tried, more than once or twice, that by diddling together common
oil of turpentine and common oil of vitriol, the former of thofe liquors would make
a feparation of fome of the fulphur, that lay concealed in the latter, and as it were
extricate and extract it : fo that befides an exceedingly fulphureous liquor, which
fometimes was made white by the copioufly difTolved (and partly precipitated) fulphur,
that pafled into the receiver, we had in the neck of the retort a yellowifh consilient
body, which being put upon a quick coal, would, after a little yellow flame
(probably
Part II. ^Spirits.
(probably proceeding from fome adhering parts of turpentine) afford good (tore of
bluifh flame, like that of common fulphur, which it alio emulated in its fmell. And
fuch a kind of fulphur I have alfo feen, in tract of time, fettle itfelf, in no inconfiderable
quantity, at the bottom of the liquor, diftilled from the mixture of the two
above mentioned oils. Nor are thefe the only ways, by which I have obtained from
oil of vitriol manifeft proofs of its containing a mineral fulphur very like to common
fulphur.
And in particular it now comes into my mind, that I once put into a retort, together
with one part of running mercury, four parts of oil of vitriol, and having diftilled
off the menftruum, by degrees of fire, there remained at the bottom of the
glafs a very white powder. This calx, being afterwards gradually prcft with a
ftronger fire, afforded in the upper part of the retort a great many fmall bodies,
that looked like half beads of amber, and feemed to be of very fine fulphur, (but
were afterwards confounded with many other afcending corpu fcles.) This amberlike
body (which was fomewhat copious, and, as to fome portions of it, whitifh) byits
rcadinefs to be melted, by its fmell, and by the blilifh flame it afforded, when it
burned, appeared to be a kind of fulphur, which you will eafily grant to be far more
unlikely to have proceeded from fo homogeneous a body, as the quickfllvcr, than
from the oil of vitriol, which we have already (hewn to coofift of divers fulphureous
as well as many acid corpufcles. And on this occafion I remember, that, whereas
upon mingling the oils of turpentine and of vitriol in a due proportion, I have con*
ftantly oblervcd, that they incorporated into a mixture, that was deeply red (and this
may eafily be tried by letting fall two or three drops of oil of vitriol upon fome drops
of that of turpentine, and mixing them in a concave vcflel, or even in a hollowed piece
of paper) whereas, I fay, I oblcrved this, I was thereby induced to fuipeel the chymical
(for I fay not, the optical) caufe of that phenomenon might be, that the terebinthinate
oil had made a folution of divers fulphureous particles it met with in the
oil of vitriol, and by that means acquired fuch a rednefs, as we fee that common
flower of fulphur gives to the oil of turpentine, when it is diflblved in it. And to
examine this conjecture, 1 found, that divers other chymical oils, and oil of anifecds
itfelf, as remote as it is from rednefs, would prefently acquire that colour, being
carefully incorporated with a due quantity of oil of vitriol. But this conjefture is
propofed only upon the by.
As for the fulphur of minerals and metals, I confefs, I have not yet found enough,
either in chymilts books, or in my own experience, to make me willing to fpeak dogmatically
about them. And this the rather, becaufe firft, as to the fulphurs, that
nre fometimcs obtainable from fome of the minerals, I think it may be doubted,
whether they belonged to thole minerals as effential ingredients, or were only corpufcles
of common fulphur, perhaps a little altered, that were mingled in the bowels of
the earth, with other parts, that arc effential to the nature of the mineral. As we fee,
that in native cinnabar the mercury, which, according to chymilts, is a complete
metal by itfelf, is fo mixt with another body, as not to be dillinclly difccrnible, rill
it be feparated by the fire. And this cinnabar affords me an inltance, the more fit for
my prcfent purpofe, becaufe I have fometimcs by an cafy way obtained a fulphur
alfo from it : and fince we have lately noted, that the vitriolate marchafitcs afford
great ftore of common fulphur, by a grofs way of feparation, it fhould not feero
irrational to fufpccl:, that fome common fulphur may remain more cloftly mixt with
the faline and metalline parts of the vitriol afforded by the fame marchafitcs •, from
which latent corpufcles of fulphur may in part proceed the fulphureous fmell, and
Vol. L 4 L other
626 The Probuciblbness
other Tike things, that we have lately taken notice of in vitriol, and its oil. And
perhaps by the fame consideration one may account for the fulphureous qualities, that
are fometimes to be met with in the liquors, that pafs for the vinegars of mineral
bodies, and particularly antimony •, to which may now and then be added fome metalline
ores : fince, I remember, 1 have had fuch a fulphureous liquor from good leadore,
that 1 had ordered to be purpofely digged out of the mine at Mintdetp, and being
put in clofe vcflcls fpecdily conveyed to me. And that nature herfelf may blend an
imperfect mineral with lead, I have had occafion to obferve by an ore, whereof the
owner found a mine, but not being able to difcovcr what it was, defired me to inform
him. For this gave me occafion to confider the ore (whereof I have yet a lump by
me) and to obferve, that it was fo differing from the other ores of that country, that
1 did but diffidently guefs, that it was a mixture, that nature had made of lead and
antimony, till particular trials had juftified my fufpicions.
But this is not all I had to fay about the fulphurs of fofiils : for though I know,
that chymifts pretend to teach us ways of extracting the true fulphurs of minerals
and metals ; and experience allures me, that a real combufhble fulphur may be in a
pretty quantity obtained from antimony j yet there are two fcrupks, that lufFcr me
not fully to acquiefce in what they teach. The firft is this, that chymifts oftentimes
deceive others and themfelves too, by miftaking thofe things for the true fulphurs of
minerals and metals, that really are not fo : of which I (hall give a plain inftance in
the preparation, that many Spagyrifls deliver of the fulphur of antimony.
For when they have boiled that mineral in a ftrong lixivium of pot-aihes, they
foppofe, that, as by the fame operation, common fulphur is diflblved, fo the m;nftruum
feeks out, and takes up, only the fulphureous parts of the antimony : and as
common fulphur is precipitated out of the lixivium, wherein it is diflblved, by
iprinkling on it vinegar, or fome other acid ; fo they prefume, that what is (truck
down the fame way from the folution of antimony, made in the fame menftruum,
muft be the true fulphur of that mineral ; in which they are confirmed by the colour
: and yet in reality, not only the fulphur (fuppofing that there is one) but the
other pam of the antimony will be diflblved by a ftrong lixivium, and the yellow
powder, that is precipitated, is but a kind of crocus, which will fometimes after a
while (at leaft in part) fubfide of itfelf, without the help of an acid. Nor does it

that it may be made to burn ; for unlefs the colour and fmell of the flame concur, I
(hall be prone to fufpedr, that the inflammability may be apt to rife, partly from the
great comminution made of the prepared body, and partly from the additament employed
in preparing it. For thele two, and perhaps even one of them, may contribute
fo much to the inflammable difpofition of a body, that little, or no true fulphur,.
will be neccflary to make it burn. Of this I elfewhere give an inftance in plates of
copper ; from which an equal weight of fublimatc has been diftiiled : for the remaining
mafs will melt and burn at the flame of a candle, almoft as readily as fcaling-wax.

body, employed to aft on them. By which means there may emerge new concretes
of great virtue and ufc. And therefore I intend not to derogate from thofe metalline
fulphurs, which fome few matters of chymical arcana referve with great care among
the chicfcft they are proud of. And that you may the better examine thcfe fine
crocufes, as I am apt to think moft of them, and try both what they are, and what
they do , if I can light on the procefe (for I dare not truft my memory) I will at the
end of this Appendix impart to you a way of preparing fome of thofe, that are made
of metals, thole being accounted the moll difficult as well as noble. And thus much
1 now remember of the trials I made according to this way \ that I employed not
any acid menftruum, or liquor made of any particular fait, but a neutral or compounded
fait ; which, whilft it was in actual fufion, would diflblve or corrode the
very thinly laminated metal.
I do not look upon thcfe fubftances as the true fulphurs of the metals, that afford
them, but rather (as I lately intimated) fufpeel them to be a fort of fine crocufes, arid
perhaps magifteries ; which by realon of die fubtiky, and fometimes fixtnefs of their
parts, may prove ufeful to confiderable purpofes both in alchymy and phyfic
But there is another fort of bodies obtained from fome minerals, and perhaps fome
metals too, that has a greater refemblance to mineral fulphur, than the newly mentioned
crocufes have.
To this purpofe I remember, that by putting aqua fords, in a certain proportion,
upon crude antimony, and, after it was almoft totally diftilled off, increasing the fire
till a dry Jubilance began to fublime, we had in the upper part of the retort a yellow
and brittle fubftance, which being carefully feparated from the dark-coloured antimonial
powder, that was alfo elevated by the force of the fire, appeared not only by
its own colour, but that of its flame, and fome other figns, to be much of the nature
of common fulphur. Nor is this the only way, whereby we have obtained fuch a
fubllance from crude antimony, from which (if I much mif-remcmbcr not) I have had
a yellow and combuftible fulphur, even without the help of a menftruum.
Paracelsus pretends to have a way of drawing fulphurs rrem all metals-, of
which procefs becaufe 1 have found little or no notice taken by chymifts, I Hull, for
the oddnefs of if, and the reputation of the author (whom I look upon as a man of
great experience in metalline affairs) fubjoin it, as I find it among fome of his loofe
papers or fragments.

Thus far Paracelfus's proccfs •, but as I know not whether it be true, becaufe I am
not able to reduce it to practice ; fo, becaufe I do not clearly underftand his meaning,
and what is the true nature of the inftrumcnts he would have us employ, I will not
take upon me to determine, whether or no the fulphurs, he teaches us to be obtainable
by this method, be genuine ones, and fit to decide the queflion we are now
confidcring.
But whatever become of this obfeure Paracclfian procefs, what I was faying about
a fort of bodies lefs remote than the formerly defcribed crocufes from the true fulphurs
of metals (if they have any fuch) may well lubfift. For 1 remember we have fornetimes
(though the experiment did not always fucceed) by cementing very thin plates
of a certain metal with burnt allum, and afterwards dexteroufly elevating the more
difpofed parts with fal armoniac, obtained a fublimate, from whence we feparated,
by ablution with fair water, that diffolved the fait, a fubftance, which, by its inflammability,
appeared a kind of metalline fulphur.
And this may fuffice touching the firft fcruple I thought fit to propofe, concerning
the factitious fulphurs of metals and minerals. To proceed therefore now to my
fecond fcruple, it may, I think, be fufpe&ed, that even this fort of bodies, which I
have mentioned to have been drawn from a metal and from antimony, may not be
the effefts of a bare feparation of pre-exiftcnt fulphur, from the other ingredients
of the bodies, that yielded them, but new concretes produced by the operation of the
fire on thofc bodies, and by the combination of fome of their parts with thofe of
the additament, employed to obtain the fulphurs. For, as far as I have yet fcen,
either falt-petre, crude or diftilled, or menftruums made of it, or of other falts, or
ellc oleaginous liquors, are wont to be made ufc of on thefe occafions. And it is
very poflible, that fome of the more difpofed parts of thefe additaments may affociate
themlelves with thole of the mineral or metal tc be wrought upon •, and fo, from this
combination of the ingredients, there may refult a body of a new texture, which
texture may difpofc it to be combufliblc, or inflammable, whether the ingredients in
their fcparate condition were fo or not. As 1 remember I have clfewhere fhown, that
though aqua fortis be not inflammable, nor a piece ofcrude copper inflammable or combuihble
in a common moderate fire, yet the metal being diffolved in aqua fortis, and the
iuperfluous moifture warily exhaled, there will remain a fufible concrete, wherein the
copper being much comminutcJ, and its fmall parts fitly affociated with the falinc ones
of ti e nienftruum, compose a kind of vitriol, that being held to the flame of a candle,
or even of a piece of paper, will readily burn away in a flame finely coloured j and
which may, if one plcafe, be kept in a flame dillinct from the other.
To conclude what I have to lay about my (ccond fcruple; it Hems not improbable,
that if any of the metals be, by a fit menftruum, or fome other congruous
additaments, reduced to parts minute enough, and that thefe parts be fitly affociated
with fume of tho!e of the menftruum-, the metal may thereby be brought to burn
or Same, as I have fuccchfuliy trie.', by a way clfewhere declared, upon gold itfclf,

able to the nature of fulphur) incombuftible ; fo that, for aught yet appears, it is
allowable to fufpecl, that the fulphur obtained from this or that metal is not fo much
an elementary or hypoftatical principle barely extracted, as it is a magiftery, or fomc
other new compound, made by the combination of the metalline particles with all, or
fomc of the body, that works on them. But if a chymift will have metalline preparations
of this kind to be fulphurs ; I may be allowed to make them ferve for initances
of the produciblcnefs of fulphurs.
Yet thefc doubts concerning the fulphurs of metals I propofc but as fufpicions,
to draw on further and more accurate trials ; by which perchance they may be happily
removed. And fpeaking of the fulphureous principle of mixt bodies, in that general
notion of it, wherein the chymifts often ufc it, and indeed mud employ it ; we may
be thought to have faid enough to our prefent purpofe, though we had left mineral
fulphurs untouched , fince we have lhewn, that inflammable parts of mixt bodies
may be produced, and therefore cannot be lafely affirmed to have all been pre-exiftent
in them.
O F T H E
PRODUCTION of MERCURY.
PART IV.
THEcomplaint I have divers times had occafion to make, of the darknefs and
ambiguity, that chymifts have allowed thcmfelves, if not aflfefted, in treating
of their three principles, is applicable to nothing more juftly, than what they have
written about that, which they call mercury. For when they would feem to tell us,
what they mean by that principle, they are wont to do it in terms fo loofe and fo ambiguous,
that the reprefentations diey make of it, arc more like to panegyrics, and
fomctimes to riddles, than to clear definitions, or fo much as good defcriptions.
Since then they have given us no fettled notion of what they call mercury, but have
left us to guefs what they mean by it v I hope a miftakc about it (if I mould run
into any) would appear pardonable. That which is agreed on by the moil of chymifts,
when they lpeak lomewhat intelligibly of the principle they call mercury, is,
that it is a crude fubftance, and that it is a volatile liquor ; which, by being fo, may
be diftinguifticd from the faline principles, efpecially from the alkalizate or fixed
fait ; as it may alfo be from the oil or fulphur, by its not being inflammable. But
thefc marks will not dilcriminate it from phlegm, which is alio a fugitive and uninflammable
liquor i and therefore to make difference, they mult add ibmc other quality,
fuch as l'apor (wkich yet agrees not to quitkfilvcr ilfelf) that is wanting to
phlegm. So that, according to this doftrine, the nature of a chymical mercury or
lpint will ccnlift in its being a liquor volatile, not inflammable like oil or fulphur,
nor yet infipid like phlegm. How odd a principle this muft be, that comprises fuch
differing bodies, as are acid fpirits, thofe of nitre and vitriol ; urinous, as tlioi'c of

blood, hartfliorn, £?V. and anonymous ones, as thofe of guaiacum, honey, raifins,
Uc. forced from their acidity •, and the running mercuries ot minerals and metals, as
cinnabar, antimony, and lead* under one principle, which, to defcrve that name,
ought to have all the portions of matter belonging to it homogeneous-, I may fafely
leave any confidering naturalift to judge. And therefore inftead of taking further
notice of this, it may fuffice for my prefent purpofe to mind you, that as for the
mercuries or uninflammable fpirits of vegetables and animals, I have endeavoured
to fhow their production, where I difcourfe of that of fpirits and volatile falts. And
therefore I need but fay fomcthing of the production of mercury more properly fo
called, that is, running mercury : about which perhaps it will not be lefs acceptable
to you, and I am furc it will be lefs troublcibme to me, if I leave you to gather my
opinion out of three papers, that were written for differing virtuofi, at feveral times,
and on diftinct occafions upon which account, beftdes thofe particulars that relate
to our prefent argument, you will perchance find fomc things, that you have not
clfcwhere met with.
Whether Mercury may be obtainedfrom metals and minerals, or ( to /peak chymically) An
demur mcrcurii corporum ?
fftHAT there may be extracted or obtained from metals and minerals a fluid
I fubftance, in the form of running mercury, is the common opinion of chymifts
; in whofe bodies we may meet with many procefles, to make thefe mercuries :
which becaufe they are faid to be afforded by mineral, and cfpccialiy metalline bodies,
thefe writers affect to call (how aptly I now examine not) mercurios corporum.
But notwithstanding all this, divers of die more learned of the Spagyrifts themfelves
have looked upon the pretenfion of other chymifts to the art of making thefe
mercuries as but a chymical brag ; and fome judicious modern writers, applauded
therein by moft of the mechanical philol'ophcrs, have proceeded fo far, as to explode
all thefe mercuries of bodies as mere non-entia chymica j nay, fome of them have not
fcruplcd to cenfure all thofe, who pretend to have leen or made any of them, as credulous
or impoftors.
In the management of this controverfy, I confefe I am not fatisfied with either of
the coneending parties •, and therefore I jnall not refufe to comply with your curiofity
to receive in a few lines my thoughts, whether there are or may be any fuch mercuries,
as arc difputed of; yet I dcllre leave to premife fuch a ftate of the controverfy, as I
think will avoid fome verbal janglings, and at leaft acquaint you clearly with the
fenfe, wherein I defire to have my opinion underftood.

. 631
To give you now my prefent thoughts about this queftton, I (hall offer them to
your confideration, in the following prupofitions.
There are divers proctffes of making the mercuries of bodies, that are fo darkly delivered, Pnt- ,-
that the generality of ebymifts cannot fufficienlly under/land them, to be able to try them.
For fome of thefe procefies are fet down in terms of an, which, for their great darknefs
or ambiguity, are not to be understood but by the authors themfelves, or thofc,
who are verled in the more myftcrious parts of hermetic philofophy. And others
there are of thefe procefTcs, that require lome menltruum, falts, or other inftruments,
that it is not in the power of ordinary chymifts to procure. Inftances of this kind
may be frequently enough met with by thofe, that have the curiofity to perufe heedfully
the writings of thole, that pafs for the adept philofophers. And for a fpecimen
of fuch procefies, I am content to annex to the dole of this paper the way delivered
by LulHus of making mercury of filver, Helmont's way of preparing mercury of lead,,
and Paracelfus's way of extracting the mercuries of all metals.
There arc divers proceffes to make mercuries of bodies, that are either falfe, or accom- r^.u,
panted with circumflances, that make them unfit to be trufted. For there are of thefe
procefies, that having been curioufly tried by thofe, that had a great defire to find
them true, have not been found to fucceed at all in practice. Hence we have fo
many complaints of chymifts, that have loft their labour in endeavouring to make,
according to Beguinus's directions in his Tyrocinium Chymicum, the mercury of filver,
though 1 do not take that to be one of the difficulteft to be prepared ; and he, that
converfes much among thofe, that have made attempts to make the mercuries of other
bodies, as gold, antimony, &c. according to the vulgar procefies extant in chymical
books, will (if I miftake not) find by their confeflions, how little the events of their
endeavours anfwer their labours and expectations. Nor do all the manufcript proceffes,
that are communicated to private friends, as great arcana, much excel thofe
I have been fpcaking of; as fcvcral of my acquaintance have complained to me, that
they have found to their coft. And here not to mention my own experience (which
by the help of good principles made me timely defift from unlikely attempts) amongft
many chymifts 1 have known, I remember not to have found above three or four credible
perfons, that would affirm to mr, that they made, or law made, the mercury
of any metal or mineral (except of native cinnabar, which is the natural ore ofquick-
Giver) in a conftant way, by any procefs he had found in printed books : fo that fo
many of thefe procefies having been upon trial found falfe, wary men may be excufedv
if they do not think fit to believe other procefies of mercurification j which, though
not yet tried, fecmed not more probable, than thofe, that have been already found founfuccefsful,
that not only many learned modern naturalifts, but Angelas Sala, and
divers others, eminent chymifts themfelves, have publifticd to the world, that thefe
mercuries arc to be found no where, but in the bragging chymifts books and promifes
-, and fome have, as has been already intimated, gone fo far as to brand all thofe
for cheats, that pretend they can make fuch mercuries, and thofe for credulous, that
believe they can be made. But what I think of this fevere opinion, I lhall quickly
have occafion to declare.
There are fome p^occfj'es, wherein it is / fought, that the mercury of a metal or mineral^
is cbtained \ -atat indeed the obtainedfttbftance is mifnamed, or the true mercury, that is
pad to be extracted, -was put in, though in a difguifed form, by the operator.
I will not here give inftances of the fubtle cheats, that may be put upon the ignorant
and unwary, and fometimcs too upon the fisilful, i£ they be not alio cautious-,,
but
632 The Producibleness
but fliall content myfelf to illuftrate the propofition by a few known, and therefore
innocent, inftances. And firft there arc fome, who finding thcmfclves unable to
make the true mercuries of metals or minerals, make bold to afcribc the name of
mercuries to produ&ions, whofe qualities arc very remote from thofe, that are agreed
to be eflential to quickfilver. Thus Glauberus fpcaks much of his mercury of Luna,
which yet is far from being running mercury, or having the ponderofity and other
properties of true quickfilver. So Angelus Sala himfelf, in his anatomy of antimony,
would have us to look upon the reguline parts of that mineral, as its mercury : becaufc
he takes it for granted, it mutt contain mercury, and is pleated to fancy no
other can be obtained from it. But the difference of the reguline part of antimony,
and running mercury in point of confiftencc, gravity, and other qualities, will, I
prefume, indifpofc men to confound them. And therefore, I will proceed to confirm
the fecond part of our propofition, by fhewing, that the mercury obtained by ibme
proceffes, that may fucceed, made part of the additament employed by the artift,
in the operations, and fo was not properly extracted from the metal, but only recovered
from the body, compounded of the metal and the additament. Of this, I
remember, I have elfewhcre given an eafy inftance, in a deluding experiment, that I
long fince (hewed fomc virtuofi, in whole pretence having mingled the filings of
copper with a certain fait, and put them in a conveniently fliaped veflcl of glafs, I
wanly held it over a competent fire of well kindled charcoal, till the fait was thoroughly
melted, and in part fublimed : by which operation the copper feemed to be
quite changed, efpecially in colour, and was really become inflammable : and there
remained in the lower part of the glafs a pretty deal of running mercury, fo that they
would have gone away pcrfuaded, that they did fee me make the mercury of Venus,
if 1 had not been careful to undeceive them ; which I did by telling them, that this
quickfilver was only the common mercury, that lay difguifed in the compounded
fublimate I had employed, together with the copper, which fet the mercury at liberty
from the corrofive falts it lay concealed in before, by prefenting them a metal more
difpofed to be wrought on by them, than quickfilver is.
It is poJJiMe to obtain, at leaft from fotnt metals ana" minerals, true running mercuryy
that cannot be juflly thought to come merely from the additament. This propofition a
chymift might more compendioufiy exprefs by turning it into this fhort aflcrcion,
Dantur mercurii corporum , but I thought the words I have employed would exprcls
my fenfe more warily and clearly ; and yet, ex abundanti, I fliall add this further explication,
that thcugh the propofition (peaks affirmatively but of fome metals and
minerals-, yet it does not deny, either that more minerals, or that all metals, may
afford true running mercury : by which I underftand (according to what I formerly
noted) a mineral body fluid, op.-.cous, exceeding ponderous; amalgaimble with gold,
and not apt to wet or flick to one's fingers, or any other bodies, befides fome metalline
and mineral ones.
That fuch a mercury may be obtained without the help of additamcnts, whereof
quickfilver is an ingredient, I have been pcrfuaded to believe by the following oblerv;
itions.
I remember, that many years ago, having had an occafion to diftil copper with
certain falinc fubftanccs, I was not a little furprifed to find in the veffcls (that had
been luted together) fome globules of running mercury, which I could not reafonably
fufpect to come from the additament, which was not fublimate, nor any thing I could
judge to contain quickfilver. And though the indifpofition I had to admit the mercuries

curies of bodies, that fo many learned men looked upon as non-entities, made me
fomewhat diffident of the genuinenefs of the mercury I had obtained (whereof I had
not quantity enough to make ju ft trials) yet afterwards, when I found that accidents of
the like nature had happened to feveral of my friends, I began to think, tiiat what
1 had kept only for a few days as a queftionable rarity, might really have been venereal
mercury.
A laborious chymift of my acquaintance coming to vifit me once, when I was
not well, was very earneft with me to communicate to him the way of making the
mercury of antimony and of Saturn •> and when I told him, that I had no fuch prof
cefics of my own, and that I was far from believing thofe, that I had met with in
printed books, to be true ones, he would not acquielce in this anfwer , but declaring,
that he refolved to make attempts to gain fuch mercuries, and had rather do it by
methods of my propofing, than of his own devifing, he prcflcd me fo much to let
him know, which way I would go to work, in cafe I had the fame defign, that he
then had, that to be rid of his importunity, J told him what on a fudden came into
my thoughts. And as fometimes the mind being put to fuch plunges, happens upon
a lucky hit, and fuch as much premeditation would not have led it to j fo it happened
at that time to me : for when J, becaufe of my diftemper, had forgot this affair, the
chymift, who was a plain honcft man, came to me with great joy to give me thanks
for the inftructions 1 had given him, bringing along with him fome mercury of antimony,
and a little mercury of lead, that he had already made by the help of thofe
inftruftions , by purfuing which, he expected to obtain much more mercury from
the minerals when they Ihould be longer digefted with the concourle of the air, in
thofe falts, that I had advifed him to grind with them. This pleafing fuccefs of
directions, which I had as to divers particulars forgotten, made me defire them of
the chymift •, who, beginning to be proud of his attainment, when he perceived I
remembered not fo much as he thought I did, ungratefully delayed to bring me the
account he promiied me at firft, till the plague reaching to the place, where he
lived, and difpatching him, deprived me of the hopes of fatisfying my curiofity.
Two gentlemen of my acquaintance, but unacquainted with each other, working
almoft at the fame time upon filver, did each of them, to his wonder, find p:irts of
his filver turned into running mercury ; with which edd accident each of diem came
to acquaint me, bringing along with them a little portion of the unexpected mercury.
One of thefe port.ons a fcrvant of mine loft by miftake, before I could try
any thing with it •, the other I found, by a trial unknown to the maker of it, not to
be common, but metalline mercury ; of which the chymift complained to me, that
he had fometimes had confiderable quantities to his great lofs, becaufe much of the
filver he employed in an operation, that he expected would prove lucriferous, being
turned into quick (ilver, had fwallowed up all his gain ; and this was that, which invited
him to apply himfclf to me, hoping to be able to prevent or remedy this inconvenience
by my advice ; which I willingly n avc nim> uut> becaufe of his departure
out of England, could not know with what fuccefs.
A fellow-! r avellcr of mine, having occafion to employ a falinc body about
lead, after he had finiilied his operation, left the lead and fait together tor fome
months, in a vcfiel, which he laid by in a garret, where the air had accefi to it
:
afterwards wanting fuch a veftel, and not being able to fupply htmleJf readily in the
country (in which his experiment was made) he remembered this long neglected
refit), and coming to fee, whether it was fit for his turn, he found to his wonder,
Vol. I. 4 M thai
Tie Producibleness
that though he had employed no mercurial body to work upon the lead, yet paw of
jt was already turned into quickfilver, feparaWe by (training, and more feemed in a
near dilpofitbn to admit the like change : whereupon he brought me, as a rarity, a
part of the metal, and a little of the mercury, which 1 found by experience on gold
to be of a nobler kind than common mercury. And I the lefs wondered at this mercurification,
becaufe examining the gentleman that chanced to make it, I found the
main thing he had employed in the operation was common or fca-fak.
An expert metallic of my acquaintance, being defiroua to try, what gold and
filver he could get out of a fine fcnglifti marchafite I had prefented him at his defire,
he examined it according to his method, without any mercurial preparation, and
found to his furprife, that it yielded him, befides other things, fome running mercury,
which he brought and gave me, becaufe it was afforded by die marchafite 1 had
prefented him.
The mercury of antimony more than one of my friends have made, by unfufpeeled
additaments, fuch as faks, that have nothing to do with fubhmate, or other
compofitions, whereof common mercury is an ingredient. One of thefe antimonial
mercuries looked lb oddly, that, though it were made by diftillation, I had that curiofity
to try, whether it would not operate on gold, m a peculiar manner ; and having accordingly
put a little fine calx of that metal (as about half a drachm or a drachm) into th<?
palm of my hand, I added to it an equal or double weight of the above mentioned
mercury ; they immediately incorporated with a very manifcft heat. And this was
the quick way I ufed to examine other mercuries of bodies j for though this alone
be not a certain fign of a mercury's being of that fort, becaufe I can obtain a mercury
fo qualified by another way than any I have hitherto mentioned ; yet as their
aflertions and relations gave me fufficient ground to conclude, that they had obtained
thofe mercuries from the bodies, that they affirm to have yielded them ; fo the rcadinels
of thefe mercuries to mix with gold, without the help of fire, and even to grow
hot with it, which vulgar mercury will not do, confirmed, that they were metalline
mercuries, rather than of the fame kind with common quickfilver. And my way of
obtaining incalefcent mercury is fo quite differing from any of thofe, that there was
not the leaft caufc to fufpect., that the mercuries of bodies we have been mentioning
were fo obtained, cfpccially fince I knew, that my way was unknown to mod of the
perfons I have mentioned, and was praclifed by none of them.
As for the mercury of gold, though I think I have brought a great many parts of
crude gold to affume a mercurial form, and to come over in that lorm by diftillation
(whatever divers learned men think of the infupcrable fixity of go!d •,) yet I confefs
I have not fren any mercury, that I was fatisficd did deferve the name of the mercury
of that metal. But happening to be once in a place, where a foreigner, that
was a ftrangcr to me, was fiiowing a friend of his, with whom I had fome little acquaintance,
a metalline experiment, that I confefs, I could not but admire •, (for this
foreigner was fo civil, becaufe I came fo lucky in, as to let me be prcfent at the experiment,
though not to difcover any thing of the drug he employed about it ;) I
made bold to alkjhis civil traveller, who feemed a candid man, and I perceived had
fcen uncommon things, whether he had met with any way of making mercury of
gold ? To which he anfwercd, that he knew no fuch way himfelf, but that he met
(fomewhile before) with a very learned man, in companion of whom he confeffed
himfelf but a novice, that put fome gold into a little phial, full of a certain mcnllnium,
which my relator owned he knew not hew to prepare, and intimated to him,
that this menftruurn would have a peculiar operation as well upon gold as filver.

Afterward this relator having put the phial well ftopt into his pocket, and carried it
about with him, was, when he came home, and took, it out to fet it afide, much fiarprifed
to find, inftead of the gold he had ken put in, a pretty quantity of running
mercury. Which the artift, who only lent him the menftruum, did not leem to think
ftrangc, when he was made acquainted with it.
Ir I would relate what I have heard from men, that I judge to be either eafily deceivablc
themfclvcs, or concerned in point of intereft to deceive others, or at leaft of
a vain- glorious bragging humour, I might eafily fwell this difcourfe to a greater bulk
but I have been careful to mention only thofe relations, to which myfelf, in fpite of
my long backwardnefs to believe fuch things, faw caufe to give affent. And if it be objected,
thefe inftances were but cafual experiments, notwithttanding which there may be
no fettled way for the obtaining the mercuries of bodies ; I might anfwer, that fomc paffages
of what has been lately delivered make it probable enough, that even fettled
ways of making the mercuries of bodies, or at leaft of fomc of them, arc not unknown
to fome arrifts ; though for certain reafons, and particularly for the ingratitude
of many men, they do not think fit to divulge them. But to anfwer more home to
the objection, I (hall need only to fay, that though mod of the above-recited experiments
may be faid to have been made by chance, in this refpect, that thofe, that
made them, did not principally defign the obtaining of metalline or mineral mercuries
j yet the effects produced were as naturally and neceflarily confequent to operations
fo managed as they were, as if the artift had directly defigned them, as in fome
of the above mentioned relations they did. And it is not material for us to enquire,
whether the quickfilver made by thofe experiments be to be afcribed to chance or
Ikill •, fincc whatever becomes of that queftion, it is plain, that if metals and minerals
could by either way be brought actually to afford running mercury, there needsno
more to prove, that fuch mercuries are really obtainable from ; hem.
Doubts about the prt-exiftence of running Mercury in metals.
THE propofed queftion, Whether or no the mercuries of metals and minerals
be principles pre-cxiftcnt in them, and only extracted from them, may to many
fecm, though it do not to you, a fupcrfluous enquiry ; fincc the generality of chymifts,
of differing ages and countries, have rcfolutcly determined it in the affirmative
: which is not at all to be wondered at, fince according to their hypothefis of
the tria prima (or three hypoftatical principles) whereof" they prefume all perfectly
mixed bodies to be compofed, metals, being of this fort, mult confift of mercury,
as well as of fait and fulphur ; and confequently muft afford it upon the analyfis of
the body into its three primordial ingredients. But notwithftanding all this, the
problem feems to me difficult enough to be refolvcd, partly becaufe fuppoling, that
there be true metalline mercuries pa-parable by chymtfts, they very ftudioufly conceal
the ways of preparation ; and partly, becaufe as it is very' difficult to obtain any of
the factitious mercuries, wherewith to make fuch lucriferous trials, as a naturalift
would defign ; fo thole few authors, that affirm themfclvcs to have poffeffed fuch
mercuries have given us but an exceeding lame and defective account of them, not
mentioning thole particulars, which are molt proper and dcfirable, in order to the
patting a right judgment about them. I pretend not then-fore to anfwer your queftion
otherwise than conjccturally, till I (hall be better furnifhed with matters of fact.
But in the mean while, that 1 may comply with your curiolity, as much as I lately
4 M 2 can,
63 6 The Producibleness
can, I lhall cpnfefs to you, that for the prefent I am, by as much information as yet
I have had, inclined to think, that the mercuries obtained from metals do not clearly
appear to have been pre-exiftent in them, and only feparated from them by the artift,
but that I think, that at leaft fome of them may be further fluid magifteries of metals,
than their extracted principles. One of the moft obvious things, that fuggefted
this fufpicion to me, was, that whilft fomc metals, as tin and lead, are in fufion, they
would, to one, that ftiould not know of their being melted, appear to be many parcels
of mercury •, fince like it they are fluid and ponderous, and ftick not to crucibles,
or (tones, bricks, or almoft any other bodies, except i'ome metalline ones,
divers of which they will eafily pierce into, as quickfilvcr dots into filver or gold •,
fo that if the fluidity of thefc metals were permanent, they might pafs for mercuries.
And if in the moon and fome of the other liars, as there are mountains, fo there are
metalline mines, in cafe the heat of the climate or of the foil fhoulJ keep them conftantly
in fuch a degree of hear, as we here find fufficicnt to melt lead (which we know needs
not be very intenfc) thefc metals would there emulate the nature of mercuries, as I
have learned from travellers, that in divers parts of the torrid zone, what would here
be butter, is fluid as well as undtuous like oil, and is fold like other liquors, by meafure,
not by weight. And an inquifuivc man, who is a ftholar as well as a traveller,
afiured me, that whilft he was in fome parts of the Indies, he furniflicd himfelf with
fome liquid fubftances afforded by wounded plants, that as loon as he came near
Europe, and not before, turned into confident and pulverable bodies ; it did not
therefore feem to me impoflible, that the piercing falts, and other fubtile 'bodies, cmployed
by at tuts about the mcrcurification (as fume ftile it) of metals, may cither by
the agility of their own nature, or by fo altering the fliapes, and loofing the wonted
cohefion of the metalline corpufclcs, bring them to have fuch a texture and luch
Sores, as may enable the ethereal fubftancc, whereto lb many other bodies ov/e their
uidity, to agitate them. Thefe caufes, 1 fay, or fomc other, that may be propofed,
may poifibly keep the prepared metal fluid •, as we Ice, that though camphire be a
confident and tough body, yet fome nitrous Ipirits of aqua fortis will eafily penetrate
it, and may be brought to ftay fo long with it, that I have, for curiofity-fake, kept
the camphire fcvcral years without iofs of its fluidity, which I found that tins kind of
liquor would retain, though for trial-fake I expofed it to intenfc degrees of cold, fuch
as would freeze divers oth'T liquors. Nor did it to me feem impollible, that a fmall
quantity of appropriated additament might fuflice to put a metal into a ftate of fluidity
; tor fince we fee, that the vapour of lead can arreft quickfilvcr, and make it
a confident body •, and fince Helmcut allures us •, that the liquor alkaiicft being oneabftraCtcd
from running mercury, deprives it, and that almoft irrecoverably, of it-,
fluidity, fo as to make it pulverable •, it appears not, why nature or art may not be
able to fupply fome corpufclcs, that may expel or difab'c thofe, that keep a metal in
the form of a fluid body ; and cfpecially fince, as I have elfewhcre fliewn, the matter
of metals themlelves may (at leaft fometimes) have been a liquor, or fome Other fluid
body.
Another reafon, that induced me to fufpeel:, that the mercuries of metals and
minerals are not, as it is prefumcd, merely extracted principles or ingredients, was,
that 1 have obferved a greater dillimilitude between mercuries all of them quick, and

furniflicd with all, that is requifuc to make them pafs for true mercuries, than will
comport with the fuppoOtion, that they are fimple and primordial bodies, barely extricated
from the others, with which they were at firft commixed. But this argument
being the fubject of an entire, though Ihort, difcourfe (of the diflimilitudc of
running mercury) I need not inlarge on it in this place.
It did alio ftrengthen my fufpicion to confider, that the chymiits, that talk of the
mercuries they have drawn from metals, are not wont to tell us, what other ingredients
they obtained by their fuppofed analyfis, which left me dubious, whether
they obtained any fait and fulphur, or not •, and of what nature thofe lubftances
were, that they did obtain. For if thefc were not true fait and fulphur, the genuine*
nefs of the analyfis might be qucftioned ; becaufc it may be alleged, that the chymical
operation and the additament turning fome parts of the metal into decompounded
bodies, which mint be acknowkdged not to have been (in fuch) forms precxilknt
in them, may alfo have by change of texture turned fome other parts of the
metal into the form of mercury.
To the foregoing confidcrations, afforded me chiefly by the nature of the thing,.
I (hall, for the lake of thofe, that are moved by the authority of adept philofophers,
as they call them, add that, which among them ought to pafs for a proof from
experience. For Raymund Lulfy, whom 1 take to be one of the grcatclt chymical
philofophers, whofe writings are come to our hands, though in many of his other
books he fpcaks of mercury in a dark and allegorical fenfe ; yet in that excellent little
tract, which lie calls his Clavicula, he delivers a procefs (which is not to be wrought."*
with vulgar menftruums, though they bear the lame names wkh thofe he prefcribe* a**u*u,
and names) from the clofe whereof it fecms manifeft, that his defign was not to ex-

tract a prc-cxiftent quickfilver out of the metal propofed, but to turn the metal into
quickfilvcr; fince he orders and directs us to profecute the mcrcurification, till the
obtained quicklilver be equal in weight to the fdver, that was to be tranfniutcd.
And partly upon this 1 have ventured to ground the foregoing paradox ; that the
mercuries of bodies arc rather magifteries than extracts. For in this Lullian procefs,
it appears nor, that the mercurial principle was extracted from the fait and lulphur,
but rather that the body of the metal (without being analyzed) was turned into mercury.
And though magiftery be a term varioufly enough employed by chymifts, and.
particularly ufed by Paracdfus to fignify very different things } yet the bed notion
I know of it, and that, which 1 find authorized even by Paracelfus in fome paffage.v
where he expreffes himfclf more diftintfly, is, that it is a preparation, whereby there
is not an analyfis made of the body afligncd, nor an extraction of this or that principle,
but the whole, or very near the whole body, by the help of fome additament.
greater or lefs, is turned into a body of another kind. As when iron or copper by an
acid meiutruum, that corrodes and affociates itfelf with it, is turned into vitriol of
Mars or of Venus ; and quickfilvcr having a furficicnt quantity of aqua fortis ftrongly
abllracted from ir, is changed into a red precipitate ; or by being fubllmed up with
common fulphur, is turned into cinnabar ; or, to give yet a more appofite exampk-,.
when quicklilver (which is the body we treat of) is by the lading operation of the
fire, without external additaments, at Icaft dirt 1 rut from the igneous particles, turned
into a red powder, that chymills call Prscipilctt f>er ft.
I have received credible information, and ibme proof too, that there is a place in
TranfyhY.niay where portions of running mercury, which, when they fallout of the
ejrth, and lie a while in the air, do of themfrlvcs coagulate into permanently hard
bodies : fo little a ddtance hah nature hcricif there put between the mercurial Bui?

dity, and the folid conftftence of the fame portion of matter. So that if fo fmall a
thing (and perhaps imponderable as well as invifible) as the contact of the air can
expel, is able by its prefence to retain a mineral body in the form of a true running
mercury, as well as by its recefs to leave a folid body \ I fee not why it mould be
impofliblc for art, to interclofe fome very minute and reftlefs particles, which, by
their various and inccflant motions, may keep a metalline body in the ftate of fluidity,
much after fome fuch way, as I lately noted, that the fpirits of nitre did, for whole
years together, keep camphirc in the torm of a liquid oil.
Having now propofed lome of the confiderations, that inclined me to think, that
the mercuries obtained from metals and minerals may not have been pre-ejeiflent in
them-, the impartiality, that, I think, becomes a naturalift, obliges me to take
notice alio of thole things, that occurred to me, in favour of the received opinion
of the chymifts, in behalf of which I objected to myfclf divers fpecious
arguments.
Of thefe, the firft was the general confent of chymifts, who take it for granted,
that all metals are compofed of mercury as a material principle, and commonly more
copious, than any other conftituent part of thofe bodies ; but this being an argument
drawn only from authority was of fmall weight with me, in a controvrrfy properly
determinable by reafon and experience.
2. A stcoND objection was afforded me, by many procefles T had met with in chymifts
books, to extract the mercuries, as well as the fulphurs and falts of metals.
But neither did this argument appear to me of any great moment, for moft of thefe
procciTcs I looked upon as fictitious things ; which, if the authors of them had taken
the pains to try themfelves, they would nave found not to fucceed in practice ; and
fcarce any of them was fo flcilfully framed, as to fatisfy a confidering naturalift, in
cafe it had fucceeded, that the obtained mercury was a pure principle only fcparated
or extracted from the other ingredients of the metals, and not a relult of fome metalline
parts conjoined with fome parts of the additament •, as ic fecmed manifeft enough
to me, that the fuppofed falts of metals, that are pretended to be made by fuch preparations,
are not the principles of fuch metals, but new concretions, and indeed
not fimple, but decompounded bodies •, as is evident in the fait or fugar of lead made
with the fpirit of vinegar, and in the fait of fteel made with that, or other acids.
3. A third objection, and of greater weight, fetmed derivable from this confideration,
that quickfilvcr cafily amalgams with metals, becaufc of its cognation
with the mercurial part thefe bodies abound with.
4. And this argument appeared capable of being ftrengthened by a more confidcrable
one j which is, that the gravity of the metals is fuch, as cannot reafonably
be deduced from any other caulc, than an abundance of the mercurial principle,
there being no other bodies (known to us) befides quickfilvcr, that are near fo ponderous
as metals.
These two objections I thought fit to couch together, to be able, in fewer words,
to anfwer them both : I confidcrcd then, that amalgamation being, in effect, but a
kind of duTolution of metals in a menftruum or fluid body (for fuch mercury is, in
reference to them) there is no necelTity, that the folvent fhould find in the metal a
copious ingredient juft of its own nature i for diflblution depends not fo much upon
the pretended cognation between the folvent and the body it is to work on, as upon
the congruity, as to fizc and figure, between the pores of the latter and the cor-'
pufcles of the former; as may appear by the folution of ivory and hart (horn
(wliich belong to the animal kingdom) that may be made with aqua fortis •, and by

that, which I have elfewherc (hewn may be made of sink, and even of copper, by
the fpirit of vinegar, the urinous fpirit of fal armoniac, and fpirit of vitriol ieparately
employed ; though the firft of them be a menftruum drawn from a vegetable, the
fecond from an animal, the third from a mineral fubftance. And as for amalgamation'-
themfelves, I obfcrve, that the facility mercury finds in joining with a metal,
does not barely depend upon the plenty of the mercurial ingredient, contained in the
metal •, at lead if the greater pondcrofity, or fpecific gravity of the metal depend
upon the copioufnefs of the fame mercurial principle, or ingredient, as the fourth,
objection fuppofcth : for we find by experience, that mercury will far more cafily
amalgam with tin than with copper, which, yet, is much more heavy than it •, nay,
than with (ilver, which is a good deal heavier, (in fpecie) than copper , and is by
chymifts prefumed to be much nearer of kin to mercury than is tin. To which I
fhall add, that although Mars be fpccifically heavier than tin, yet it is far from being
more eaDly amalgamable with mercury ; that though tin will readily admit this mineral
liquor, without the help of heat, there is no way vulgarly known to chymifts
to make an immediate amalgam between mercury and Mars. So that one of the two
objections, I lately joined together, muft be declined: fince by the trials I have purpofcff
made, it appears, that either the difpofition of metals to amalgamate with
mercury does not barely depend upon the fuppofed plenty of mercury contained in
the metal ; or clfe that the greatnels of the fpecific gravity does not depend upon the
more plentiful participation of that mercurial ingredient. Although the fourth objection
be built upon a fuppofition, that the great ponderoufnefs of metals, in companion
of other bodies, can proceed from no other caufc than the great quantity of
mercury they contain ; I confidered too, that it might be juftly demanded, whence
mercury itfelf, as well as whence metals, derive their great pondcrofity \ and I fee
not, why it may not be laid, that both the one and the other owe it to the folidity,.
and clofe order, of the corpufcles they confift of , to which qualification it is not
eflential, that the portion of matter endued with them be in a ftate of fluidity,
rather than in one of confiftencc : as on the contrary we fee, that gold and lead are
exceeding ponderous bodies, as well when they are in fufion, as when they arc cold
and hard , and fo is quickfilver, as well in its wonted and liquid form, as when it iscoagulated,
as chymifts fuppofe, by the vapour of lead.
But this will be fomewhat further cleared in what 1 fhall fay to the fifth and laft
objection, that my thoughts fuggeftcd to me, and which philosophical candour forbids
me to conceal ; though I find it cafier to be propofed than anfwercd. It may be
then alleged in the fifth place ; that the mercuries of metals muft needs be but partial
principles of them, fince quickfilver being confefledly heavier than cither the
fulphurcous or faline principle, and being fpecifically heavier, than almoft any metal
itfelf; the gravity of a metal cannot rcaibnably be fuppofed to proceed from the
whole body of the metal, but only from fome one ingredient heavier in fpecie than
the reft, and, than the metal itfelf. And this ingredient or principle can be no other,
than the molt ponderous body, mercury.
This difficulty, I confef's, does keep me yet in fome fufpence, till I have further
opportunity, to make fuch trials, as I think proper to clear it. Yet in the mean
time, I fhall offer fome few things, which pc: haps, may lefTen it, if not quite remove
it.
I consider then, that there is no neceflity to fuppofe, that metals, of what denomination
foever, as tin, iron, filver or gold, are bodies perfectly homogeneous,
though they fecm fuch to our eyes. This iuppofiuon I elfewherc purpoicly dilcourie
640 The Producibleness
of, but in this place I need not fpend time about it •, fince the chymifts (who are
thofe I now realon with) do not only allow, but teach it, fince tbey will have metals
as well as other mixt bodies to confift of* three hypoftatical principles, whereof mercury
is one, although it muft be much heavier in fpecie, than either the fait or the
fulphur it is blended with •, becaufe it is from the participation of that ingredient, that
they derive the great ponderoufnefs, which metals have, in compahfon of other
bodies.
And to this granted fuppofition, I fee not why it fhould be abfurd, to add thisother,
that the more folid and heavy particles or corpufcles of metal may lie in it,
not in the form of fluid or mercurial, but confident parts, and that thefe may be
more dil'pofed than the reft, to be brought by chymical additamcnts and the operation
of the fire into the form of a running mercury. Nor ought it to be judged incredible,
that the fore-mentioned folid portion of the metal fhould be more ponderous
than quickfilver, fince, as I have often tried, gold, though a confident body, is far
heavier than quickfilver, to the bare participation whereof gold cannot owe its fpccific
gravity.
If this hypothefis be admitted, it will be eafy to give an account, how the mercury
of a metal may be heavier in fpecie (that is, bulk for bulk) than the metal that
afforded it ; for the difficulty is cafily rcfolvcd, by faying, that the folid parts, which
by the chymical operation are reduced into the form of quickfilver, were far more
ponderous in kind, than the other parts of the metal, which being alfo aflbciated
with them, did, by their comparative lightnefs, make the entire metal lefs heavy (if
the bulks be equalled) than an aggregate or convention of all the folid parts alone
would have been. Which may be illuftrated by what I have hccdfully obferved, of
the decrement of fpecific gravity, fuftaincd by quickfilver, when it is united by fublimation
either with fulphur into cinnabar, or with falts in corrofive fublimate.
But I mu'X not diflemble, that againft the foregoing dil'courfe there occurred to me
a couple of arguments (that I have not met with amongfl chymifts) whereof the
latter is very conliderable For I forefaw it might be alleged, firft, that the mercuries
of metals being in a liquid form, could not well be fuppofed to be fo clofe and ponderous
bodies, as our hypothefis requires : and next, that we ourfelvcs admit an experiment
of Raymund Lully, whereby he pretends to reduce the whole body of lilvcr
into mercury, which is a heavier lubftancv than fiiver -, and in this cafe we cannot
have recourfe to this anfwer, that the corpufcles, which aflutne the form of mercury,
were far more ponderous than the others, that concurred with them to compofe the
metal.
This twofold objection I do not pretend to anfwer at once, but may perhaps enervate
it by degrees.
And firft, though it be very poffible, that a pretty quantity of additament may
be employtd about the mercurification (to fpeak in the chymiits language) of a metal,
yet there fhall really and finally adhere to the metalline parts, but a very fmall proportion
of additament, that will continue with them, and keep them in a mercurial
flux. And it may appear the more credible, that a very fmall quantity of additional
matter may have a very great llroke in altering the confidence of that, which is obtained
from a metal, as its moft ponderous portion, if you confiderwith me, that the
bare acccflion of igneous particles, is able in time, to turn running mercury into that
red powder, which chymifts call Precipitate perfe: and I have found by trials purpofcly
made, and ellewhere related, that this powder without any further additament
may be reduced into running mercury. Nor uiuft I pretermit, on this occafijn, a

notable paSfage I remember to have met with in Hehnont, who relates, that by the abstraction
of the liquor alkaheft (which is wont to come all over in diftillation from
common quickfilver) he did quite deprive it of its fluidity, and turned it into a confident
body, and even into a fixed one •, whereby you may fee how little a quantity
of matter will ferve to change the confidence of a body of a mercurial nature.
Besides that, a fluid form docs not always argue the lightnefs of the body, that
it is found in, fince it may confift of particles fo folid and fo numerous, that, notwithstanding
their intcftine motion, the body they compofe may be very ponderous :
as may appear by red-hot iron, melted lead, and, which is an initance appofite to
our purpofe, in common quickfilver, which though fluid is heavier than any known
body in the world, gold excepted.
But I confider farther, that though the folid portion of a metal retain more of the
additaments employed to bring it into the form of mercury, than it can be proved to
contain •, yet this disadvantage may be compenfated by the new difpofltion of parts,
that the mercurified portion acquires by the operation, that turns it into a liquor, and
may be fuppofed to bring the parts to a clofcr, or otherwife a more expedient order
than they were in before ; as ice when thawed takes up lefs room in the form of
water, than it did before it became a liquor. I fee no impoflibility, that the Specific
gravity of metalline bodies may be increafed or diminished by fuch fmall proportions
of additaments, as do not at all confiderably add to their abfolute gravity.
This the chymifts ought not to deny, if they confider what themfelves grant of the
efficacy of what they call the philofophers ftone, whereof they tell us, that one grain,
if it be of a nobler order or degree, may tranfmute a whole pound of quickfilver
into perfect gold and confequently the Specific gravity of a metal is notably changed
by an additament ; which (according to the differing pounds tiled in Several countries)
amounts not, perhaps to the fixth or Seventh thouSandth part of its weight. Befides,
the tranfmuting powder being a compounded body, whereof but part is gold,
may probably be fuppofed to be more light in Specie than the metal, that by addition
of it is produced •, which being pure gold, is the pondcroufeft body yet known to us.
And to confirm the argument, 1 Shall add, that there is a way, though I pretend not
<o know it, of making a metal far lighter in Specie, than it naturally is, by the addition
of lcSs than a hundredth part of its weight, as experience has convinced me.
Wherefore to come now to the grand objection turniShcd by Lul'y's lately-mentioned
experiment, it will not preiently follow, that if the whole body of a metal be
brought into a mercurial form, this mercury will fwallow up and deitroy our hypothefis
: for though I grant, that, in this caSe, it cannot be Said, as in the former
caSes (wherein a part only of the metal is mercurified) it may be, that the obtained
quickfilver confifts of the more folid and ponderous parts of the metal ; yet it may
be fiill Said, that, for aught we know, the mercury, produced by the reduction of
the whole metal into a fluid form, may be Specifically lighter than common mercury,
and So cannot be neceSfarily concluded to be Specifically heavier than the metal, that
aifbrded it. I lately employed the words, fcr aught we know, becauSe we are now
upon the cale, wherein philoSophical candour invited me to acknowledge, that I
wanted further trials to give mylelf lull Satisfaction : for although I have had portions
of the mercuries of more than one or two metals, yet it was but in Small quantities
•, So that the other trials, I had the curiofity to make with them, kept me from
examining their Specific gravity, and from finding by an hydroftatical way, that I have
elfcwhere declared, whether they were not lighte r in Specie than inferior mruls, and
consequently than common mercury. For thai quickfilver may be Specifically lighter
Vol. I. 4 N than
642 the Producibleness
than the metal that affords it, I think the chymills cannot rcafonably refufe to
grant •, fince they allow, that running mercury may be obtained of gold, and tell
us great matters of it, becaufe of its proceeding from fo noble a body. Now if
this golden mercury be faid, becaufe of the fuppoi'cd icfemblance of all mercuries,
to be of the fame fpecific weight with common quickfilver, then I have a notable
infbnce of a mercury, that rs confiderably lighter in fpecie, than the metal, that
afforded it. And therefore, till experience have manifefted the contrary, it will not
be abfurd to prelumc, that the mercuries of other metals may likewile be lighter in
fbectt, than the refpective bodies, from which they were obtained : but if it be faid,
that this golden mercury may perhaps be as ponderous as gold itfelf or even more,
then it is plain, that it is poffible tor a metalline body, notwithftanding its being
reduced into the form of a fluid, to be equiponderant to the metal, that afforded it.
And that I may not fcem to argue altogether from the conccfllons the chymifts ought
to make, I will add, by way of confirmation, a couple of things, that perhaps you
will think fomewhat ftrange. Whereof the former is, that it is poffible for a mcta£
line body to rcfemble another in all the manifeft qualities, whereby artifts are wont to.
examine them, and yet they differ much from it in fpecific gravity : as I had once
opportunity to obferve in a metal, that was not only white (within and without) like
filver, and very malleable, but did, when I purpofcly examined it, endure cupcllation,
and paffed for, and was reputed by a very eminent artift, that fent it me to
examine, to be good filver in all proofs ; and yet this metal I found by hydroftatical
trials to be much lighter in fpecie, than common filver. And if the famous pcrfon,
that fent it me, was not miftaken (for fo I mud not think he would knowingly mifinform
me) this odd metal may yield me a notable inftance to my prefent purpbfe,
fince he affirmed this metal to be made without the addition of any metalline body of
quickfilver •, which, if this be fo, mud, by a change of texture, have made a confiderable
lofs of its fpecific gravity. But to proceed to my fecond inftance, which
will be yet more oppofite ; I ftiall add, that once I had a mercury, which amongft
other remarkable properties, that belong not to this argument, had a very ftrange
one ; namely, that it was confiderably heavier in fpecie than common mercury (as I
found and (hewed to a great virtuofo by hydroftatical trial) though it was made of a
body no heavier than common mercury, and by the help of additaments, which were
much lighter than common mercury. And this was fo far from being a more grofs
and fluggifh kind of quickfilver than the ordinary, that it looked very fine, and was
very agile, and had, before I examined it, been more than once diftilled. By this it
may appear, that from hence, that a body is in a mercurial form, we cannot fafcly
determine what degree of fpecific gravity it has. For fince by this laft example it
appears, that a fort of quickfilver may be far more ponderous than common quickfilver
•, it feems not unreafonable, that a fort of quickfilver may be far lighter than
common mercury, and fo perhaps lighter than the metals, that were reduced into that
form : it being far lcls likely, that the former fhould be produced than the latter, in
r<-y;)rd there is but one mineral body in the world, that we know of, at all heavier
than common quickfilver ; whereas there are many of thofe, that are capable of
being affociated with it, that are far lighter than it.
But, as I intimated above, I am unwilling to fpeak fo pofitively about this matter
as 1 might do, if I had opportunity to make the trials I would with the mercuries of
bodies: only thus much 1 lhall venture to fay, that, for aught yet appears, the argument,
I have been anfwering all this while, is not cogent, fince it is built upon a luppuiiuon,
that the mercuries afforded by metals and minerals mull be of die fame

weight with common mercury ; which is not only a prooflefs aflcrtion, but repugnant
to the experiment lately mentioned of the distilled mercury, that was heavier then
common mercury, and to the prefumption derived thence, that there may be bodies,
in a mercurial form, more light in fpecic than common mercury. And whatever becomes
of the opinion I incline to; the argument I have been examining of the chymifts,
may be invalidated by what I have faid, where I took notice of the notable
excels of ponderoOty, that pure gold has in regard of common quickfilvcr : for by
that inftance it plainly appears, that it is not to the participation of common mercury,
that metals muft neceflarily owe their great ponderofity, but that nature (and art too)
may contrive the parts of a body into fo cbfe an order, as to make that body
(whether folid or fluid) more ponderous, bulk for bulk, than common quickfilver
icfelf.
Havinc now difpatched what I intended to fey in the foregoing djfcourfe, it remains,
that I perform the promife I made, of adding the ways of mcrcurification
(as chymifts fpeak) above referred to, as delivered by Paracelfuj, Helment, and Lullj
about which I muft give you this advertifement, that befides the obfeurities, and imperfections,
that a moderate degree of attention may enable you to difcover in thefe
procefles, underilood in the literal fenfe, there are, if I much miftake not, feme
affected equivocations in terms, that feem very plain, and free from fufpicion of
ambiguity. As for inftance, though the word fal armoniacum feem to be of this fort,
yet amongft Hermetic philosophers it often fignifies, not common fal armoniac, which
is far from being able to perform the effects they afcribe to theirs, but a very differing
and much more noble and operative thing ; which, becaufe it may be fublimed like
common fal armoniac, they are pleafed to call by that name. And though fometimes
they give it the tide of fal armoniacum pbilofopborum, yet oftentimes they omit the difcriminating
epithet, cfpecially in philofophical procefles (that is, fuch as thofe,
wherein they deliver their higher arcana) ot which fort are ma/iy of Paracelfus'% procefles,
and more (not to fay moll) of LulJfs. What is meant by fal armoniacum pbilofopborum,
I think it ncedlefs to tell you here (but may perchance do it on another
occaflon ;) fince that compofition requires an ingredient, that neither of us is furniflied
with, and that you cannot procure. There may be other ambiguities in the
following procefles, that will not be cafily difcovcrcd, but by fuch as arc vcrild in the
myfterious language, which fome would call canting, of the Hermetic philofophers.
But, I think, I have faid enough already to fliew, that the annexed procefles are fit to
confirm, what is delivered upon the firft propofition of die foregoing difcourfc v and
therefore without offering to explain them, I (hall lubjoin them in the proper terms of
the respective authors.

Part IV. of Mercurt*
Of the diJJirmSiude «f running mercury.
BEFORE I undertake to give you my opinion about your queftion, I muft crave
leave to ftate it fomewhat more clearly, by propounding it thus : whether all the
bodies, that in the (hops, and among chymifts, pafs for true running mercuries, are
homogeneous ; or fo much of one and the fame nature, that the feveral portions of
fuch mercuries are but numerically different ? Now to the queftion thus (tared, the
fear of feeming to maintain a paradox, by difienting from the generality of chymifts,
as well as naturalifts (who are wont to employ indifcriminately all running mercuries
not manifeftly adulterated) will not keep me from returning a negative anfwer.
And though it were not over difficult for me to give you the reafons of my opinion,
drawn up into method, and refer feveral inftances I (hall produce, fome to the
depuration of quickfilver, fome to die impregnation of it, fome to the coition, and
others to two, or all thefe ways of altering it •, yet I ihall rather prcfent you with
them, by way of loofe obfervations, becaufe I prefume that freedom will not be uaacceptable
to you, as it will allow roe, to give you fome few, but uncommon notices
and hints about fuch noble fubjc&s as prepared mercuries.
i. In the ririt place, then, it may be obferved, that a running mercury may be
brought to differ from common quickfilver by depuration : for there are in moft mercuries
either recrementiuous particles, or at leaft fome loofe adherencies, that are fcparable
from the reft of the body ; and which being feparated, the mercury becomes
more homogeneous or clean, than it was before this external depuration (for fo I call
it, to diftinguUh it from another, that is internal) that is ufually made, by grinding
and walhing mercury very well with fait and vinegar (for which purpofe, I alio fometimes
ufc fpirit of wine) which one may not unfrequently fee lbmewhat fouled, by
what it carries off" from the mercury, which is alfo fometimes attempted to be purified
. by the more laborious way of diltillation ; which, though in fome cafes infufficient
(as I Ihall ffiew anon) is in fome others very convenient ; whereto fome artifts add
other probable means, tending to the fame purpofe. So that I do not wonder to find,
that divers philofophical Spagyrifts themfclves, before they proceed to more intimate
preparations of mercury, order it to be feveral times prcvioufly incorporated and fubbmed
with acid falts or fulphurs, and then revived with alkalies. Since without
examining their grounds it may be faid, according to mechanical principles, that by
diligent commixtures the mercury is divided into cxccediagly minute, if not invifible
globules, or fuch like parts ; and by this great comminution, it acquires far more
of furface than it had before, by which means a great multitude of feparable parts
come to be touched, almoft of every fide, by the lalts or fulphurs, to which by this
means, when the quickfilver is driven from them in the revivification, it is probable,
that very many of them ltick, that were not fuperficial, when all thefc globules made
up bur one mercurial mafs. And it is poflible too, that the alkalies employed to revive
the quickfilver, in a) help to tear oft from it fome of the feculent particles, which
the chymifts would defire to have it freed from. And here, let me advertife you
upon the by, that there is no neccffity to have recourlc to fait of tartar or quicklime,
or fuch like alkalies for the reviving of quickfilver: and therefore when I would,,
with cafe, obtain a clean and active mercury for fome purpofes, I do not employ acid
and then alcalizate falts, but mix very wJl common cinnabar finely powdered with a
double weight, or at leaft, an equal weight of filings of iron, or ftcel. For thefc
being diftilkd together in a low retort with a imart fire, the fulphur of the cinnabar
6 will.
646 The PRODUCIBLBNEGS
will fallen upon the filings, and let the mercury come over fair and vivid, and perhaps
fomewhat impregnated with a martial virtue, upon whofe fcore it may be better
than if it had been prepared by mere depuration.
a. And this leads me to the mention of another way of diverfifying mercury,
which is by impregnation, either corporeal, or fpiritual (if for diftinction fake I may
fa call them.) But the impregnation being a comprehenfive way, divers particular
methods may, after a manner, be referred to it : yet becaule the true grounds offuch
references are fometimes hard enough to be afligned, at lcafl in few words, I lhall
allow myfclf, without fcrupuloufly regarding them, to proceed in my free obfervations.
3. The next thing then, upon whofe account a running mercury may come to
differ from common quickfilver, is a fpiritual impregnation. By mercury fpiritually
impregnated I mean that, with which fome fubtilc parts of another body are fo intimately
aflbciated and united, that not only the additament will pafs with the mercury,
when it is (trained through leather (though that be the means, by which artiils
ufually fcparate gold itfelf from the mercury, wherewith it has been amalgamcd) but
will alfo continue with it after diftillation, without hindering the mercury from being
vivid enough. I know there are many chymuts, cfpecially among the more cautious,
that look upon quickfilver as fo heteroclite a mineral, that as no body can fallen
enough upon it, to alter it intrinfecally, fo it will not admit any other body to be
aflbciated with it any thing intimately, or permanently. And indeed fince we find,
that when gold itfelf, with which of all bodies whatsoever mercury is believed to
have the greateft fympathy, may yet be feparated from it by ftraining an amalgam of
thole two metals through leather, which will tranfmit the quickfilver, and retain the
gold j and if fuch an amalgam be diftillcd with a competent fire, the mercury will
afcend, and leave all the gold behind in the retort ; fince mercury I fay, is fo feparable
from gold itfelf, it may feem improbable, that it Ihould be more intimately aflbciated
with any other bodies. But thefe arguments, though fpecious, do not, I
confefs, convince me, who mud not deny, but that the corpufcles of fome mineral
bodies may be fo well commixt with quickfilver, as to pafs with it through the pores
of leather , and who have found by trial purpofcly made (and elfewhere related) that
quickfilver being in a convenient proportion amalgamed with tin, or with lead, and
diftilled with a competent fire, will manifellly bring over with it.fome of the aflbciated
metal •, infomuch that not only I have found a notable increafe in the weight of the
diftillcd quickfilver, but it would both leave a tail, as they call it, behind it, when it
moved upon a (loping glafs, and (which was more) when the fluggilh mercury had
relied a while, it would appear covered over with a kind of fcum, made of the
emerging corpufcles of the tin, or lead, either of which, efpecially the former, is a
metal lighter in fpecie than quickfilver. Hence it appears, that mercury may be fo
ftridly united to a not dcfpicable proportion of a grol's and ponderous body, and of
an ignobler kind, as to carry it along with itfelf in diftillation ; which by this appears
not to be near fo certain a way, as fome learned chymifts think it, to try, whether
mercury be pure from all adulterating mixtures, and to free it from them, if it had
any belore. But the chief ufe I will make of this experiment is this, that , fince we
fee, that fometimes mercury dors not refufe even corporal impregnations (as for di-
(lin£tion fake I call thole lately recited) it ought not to appear incredible, that it may
in fome cafes admit fpiritual impregnations, and fo intimately aflbciate with itfelf
fome of the finer parts of certain metals and minerals, as not to part with them,
though they be diftillcd, and afterwards perhaps feveral times wafhed. This brings
into

Part IV. of Mercury.
into my mind, that I had once a diltilled mercury made by an impregnation of common
mercury, a drop or globule of which, being evaporated from a thin piece of
filver, not only leemcdto have iomewhat penetrated it, but (as I expefted) left upon
it a rugged fubftance apparently lighter than the furface of the piece, and of a colour
very near that of gold, from whole nature perhaps it was not very remote : but that
common mercury may indeed be fpiritually impregnated, I have been perfuaded by
divers effects, that I have tried of fuch impregnations : and I acknowledge to you,
that moft of the uncommon mercuries, that I am now proceeding to tell you of, have
been prepared after fome fuch manner.
4. Another thing, wherein a mercury may differ from common quickfilvcr, is a
facility to amalgam with gold : for it is known to gilders, goldfmiths, and others,
that are vcrfed in fuch experiments, that to make amalgams with gold and mercury,
it is ufual enough to take fix parts of the latter to one of the former, and fome take
eight or more. Nor is fo great a proportion of mercury wont to keep them from
thinking it requiGte to make both it and the gold feparably, and confiderably hot to
facilitate their commixture, but I have divers times had fpiritually impregnated mercuries
with but two parts, of which I would prefently make an amalgam with one
part of the calx, or leaves of gold, and that without any other external heat, than
that of the palm of my hand. Nay, fometimes, for trial fake, I have employed but
one part of quickfilver to make in the palm of my hand a mixture, wherein the gold
was fo far from appearing, that the colour of the quickfilver was not fenlibly fo much
as impaired.
5. Another difference between fome mercuries and rhofe that are vulgar, is, that
thefe being put to calx of gold, though one do at length bring them to mix (for it is
not fo eafily done, as men are wont to prefume) yet they will not difclofe any fenfiblc
heat, but the mixture, as each of the incorporated ingredients was, will to the touch
be cold : but though I know there are many learned chymifts, that look upon incalefcent
mercuries, that is, fuch as will grow hot upon their mixing with gold, as
chymical nen-entiot or chimxras, yet they arc not competent judges of the poffibility
of things. For I have more than once, or a few times, both alone, and in the pre -
fence of fome curious perfons, found and evinced, that a diftilled mercury may be
fo animated, that a fingle drachm of it, or perhaps a far lefs quantity, being mixed
barely with my finger, with as much, or perchance half as much, calx of gold, would
prefently conceive, not only a fenfible, but a very confidcrablc heat ; infomuch that
fometimes it would prove offenfive to the palm of my hand, wherein I made the mixture.
Divers phenomena of this experiment may be fcen in the author's little Tract
Of the InccUfcenct of Quickfilver with Gold, now extant in the Pbilofopbical Tranfactions,
Numb. 112. And I remember, that once being to convince a very eminent
chymift, that there were fuch mercuries, as I have been fpcaking of, I took a remnant
of a certain quickfilver, which I intend never to make again (and of which, for
the fake of mankind, I relolve not to teach the preparation) of whofe difpofition to
incalefcence I had fuch an opinion, that though we had no calx, nor fo much as
filings Of gold, but only fuch pieces, as he could grofsly prepare with a hammer and
a pair of Iciffors, I ventured to put my mercury to them in a glafs-mortar ; and yet
notwithftanding the thicknefs and clolenefs of the beatL-n metal, and the coldnefs of
the veflel, the mercury, to the artifl's wonder, penetrated the gold, and grew manifeftly
hot with it. And this faculty of our quickfilver was not a tranfient and cafily
vanifhing one ; for I had already kept the mercury by me for feveral years. The
incalefcent mercuries hitherto mentioned were animated by tedious and laborious
operations ;
The Producibleness
operations but if I had defired only to convince gain-fayers, I could have done it by
a very much fhorter way : for though this fort of impregnated mercuries be many
degrees inferiour to the forementioned animated mercuries, yet as to incalefcence with
gold, I know by experience a way, which is indeed hard to hit, and requires a dexterous
artift, but which, when it fucceeds aright, will in an hour, and perhaps a lefs
time, qualify mercury to grow prefentiy hot with gold.
6. When an animated mercury is by due impregnation qualified to amalgam
readily and intimately with gold, aud penetrated fo as prefentiy to grow hot with it,
it is not much to be admired, that it Ihould alio differ from common mercury, in
the being able to carry up with it part of the gold, wherewith it was fo ftrictly aflbciated.
I know, that many learned men, and among them divers chymifts themfelves,
do not think it credible, that at leaft corporal gold Ihould be volatilized by
quickfilver. And indeed that, which is common, may be many times diftilled from
gold, without carrying up any of it ; but this ought not to conclude againft fuch fpiritually
impregnated mercuries, as I lately mentioned : for with a very fmall quantity
of one or them I have fometimes elevated fo much calx of gold, that the infide and
neck of the retort were richly gilt by the adherent particles of that metal, which
would fometimes flick fo clofe, as not to be without difficulty feparated from the
glafs. And I remember too, that having- with one of thefe noble mercuries amalgamed
about half its weight at moft (if I miftake not) of calx of gold, though ic
did not gild the infide of the glafs, yet I found, as I expected, that the diftilled mercury
was manifeftly encreafed in weight, as well as fomewhat changed in colour and
confiftence : which experiment may be added to thofe, that I formerly mentioned, to
prove, that quickfilver (duly prepared) may be corporally impregnated.
7. In the amalgams made of one of thefe fpiritually impregnated mercuries with
calx of gold, I have fometimes obferved a thing, that argues fuch mercuries to be
differing from common qiuckfilvcr : of whofe amalgams with gold fuch an effect has
never (that I know) been taken notice of. The phenomenon I mean was this ; that
by diftilling one of thofe fubtile amalgams in a retort, a good part of the bottom of
the veffel, which I have yet by me, was left adorned with a very lovely colour, almoft
like that of turquois ftone, inclining towards the colour of gold, and fomewhat
changeable ; and alfo fo clofely fattened to the glafs, that it feems to have penetrated
into it, though this beautiful Itain were left by but a very fmall quantity of the amalfjjm,
and though this mixture were diftilled but in a moderate fire, fince it was in a
and-furnace. Nor is this the only experiment of this kind, that I would allege,
fince I eUewherc mention an amalgam of gold with an animated mercury, which
being long decocted, when at length by an excefllvc fire unfkilfully adminiftred the
veffel was unluckily broken, leit the lower part of the glals permanently tinged
a pure and tranfparcnt red, that fcemcrd to me to emulate that of a not common
ruby.
8. Another difference I found between ordinary quickfilver and fpiritually impregnated
mercuries, that will perhaps fomewhat iiirprize you. And it is, thai though
one would expect, that amalgams made with mercuries fo penetrant, and fo difpofed
to adhere clofely to golJ, fhould make with it amalgams far more eafy than thofe
made with ordinary quickfilver to be turned into red precipitate, yet I found the quite
contrary upon trial For whereas chymifts are wont to mention about fix weeks as
the ufual lime, wherein mercury may be precipitated twnperfe, that is, without additament,
and allow but a fhortt-r time to make th s precipitation, when it is amalgamcd
with gold (whereby fomc of it is detained, and all more expofad to the actum

of the fire j) I have had the curiofity to keep an animated mercury amalgamed with
about a third part of its weight of fine gold above twice fix weeks, without having
fb much as a grain or two of precipitate (perhaps not half fo much) that I could perceive,
though the mercury crew hot with the gold at their being mingled, and though
the mixture were purpofcly kept in a good heat capable to make quicklilver circulate.
Nor did I content myfelf with one trial, nor with one fort of animated mercury, but
in above five or fix months I obtained not one grain (that I could difcern) of precipitate,
though the heat was fo ftrong, as to carry up many parts of the quicklilver,
and of the gold with it, to the top of the glace* , nay, in one of them (which was
a fomewhat odd cafe) the fire was fo violent, that the hermetically fealed glafies bc-
Ogto melt, the fpirituous matter included in it was lb forcibly expanded, as to
the weaker fide of the glafe, and give it as it were a bunch, yet without
breaking it ; as I can Ihew you in the glafs itfclf, that I have yet entire by me. Nor
do fix months make the longeft term, that the obftinacy of my curiofity has made
me keep gold in decoction with animated mercuries without obtaining a red powder
or precipitate, though in the mean time there were produced very pretty vegetations,
and fometimes, which is far more confiderable, odd changes of colours, about which
it is not here neceffary to entertain you •» the main drift of this obfervation being to
give you notice, that as far as I have yet tried, the more fubtlc and richly impregnated
mercuries are far lefs apt to afford precipitates with gold, than common quickfilver
is. As if that difpofition to be calcined (as the chymifts are pleafed to ipeak)
or turned into powder, required the prefence of the recremenrjtious or more feparablc
part of quickfilver, that a chymift would perhaps call it fulphur, which was a
difcovery I could willingly enough have miffed. For I confefs I had fome hope, a*
well as intention, to try, whether a precipitate, made with gold and fome or thefe
noble and richly impregnated mercuries, would not prove a nobler medicine than precipitates
made with gold, and only common mercury though even of fome of thefe,
when dexteroufly prepared and kept their due time in decoction, experience invited
me to have no flight opinion j efpecially, if they be exhibited in a juu dofe, and accompanied
with a proper additament, by which they may be kept from raiGng any
falivation, and have their operation either altogether or almoft totally determined
downwards.
<j. The laft difference I fhall obferve between fome diftilled mercuries and common
3uickfilver, fhall be their inequality in point of fpecific gravity. I know you will
link this a paradox v but I can tell you, that I had once the opportunity to examine
hydroftatically a noble morcury, for the impregnating whereof neither corporal gold
nor filver was employed ; and yet having carefully weighed this quickfilver in water,
according to the method 1 ellewhere teach, in the prefence of a famous and very heedful
virtuolb, I found it, as I had foretold, not only manifeftly, but very confiderably
heavier in fpecie (that is, bulk for bulk) than common quickfilver, though this
mercury had been feveral times diftilled, and by other ways depurated : which to me
itemed to argue, that even fpiritual or volatile gold (for no vifiblc gold was employed,
and no metal but gold is fo heavy as quickfilver) is able to increafe the fpecific gravity
of mercury itfclf, which, of all the bodies we know, is exceeded or equalled in that
Suality but by one alone. And the ponderoufnefs of our lately mentioned mercury
ems to me the more wonderful, becaufe having by the fame method hydroftatically
examined a mercury, made after a ftrange way (without common mercury) 1 found it,
(cam at all to differ in gravity from common quickfilver, fince it cid not weigh full
fourteen times as much common water of the fame bulk.
Vol. I. 4 0 B»T
650 *Tbe Producibleness
But here I fhall obferve to you upon the by, that it is not a certain confequence*
to infer, that the heavier the mercury is, the more fixt it muft be-, for I remember,
that having been once fo unadvifed as to comply with the earneft folicitations of an
inquifitive gercleman, that afterward behaved himfelf very ungratefully and unworthily
to me, I gave him inftructions, how to make an animated mercury, which I
looked upon as very much of the like nature to the ponderous one, I have been fpeaking
of, but lefs tedious, and far lefs difficult to be prepared ; and while he found he
Deeded my renewed directions, according as new difficulties occurred to him, he gave
me from time to time an account of his progrefs ; and when he was advanced far in
the procefs, he informed me, amongft other things, that following my direction in
purifying and animating his quickfilver, he found it fo altered and iubttlized, that he
would diftil it in lefs than half the time he had formerly employed to drive it over,
with the like fire and veifcls.
This is what I thought fit to fay at prefent, about the differences between common
quickfilver and prepared (but yet running) mercuries. And yet I am content to add
two or three advertil'ements, for which, and cfpccially for the firft of them, you will
perhaps thank me. if ever you mould vigoroufly profecute, in a fpagyrical way, the
more noble fort of mercurial experiments.
In the firft place then, I fhall obfervc to you, that whatever fome learned chymilb,
and others, teach to the contrary, it is matter of fail, that mercuries may be animated
or fpiritually impregnated by more ways than one (not to fay, by more than a
few) fo as to penetrate gold very powerfully, and grow hot with it ; and it feems to
me very probable, upon grounds not mcerly notional, that the differing ways, that
are employed to prepare thefe animated mercuries, by impregnating them with this,
or that mineral, or metal, may much diverfify their qualities end operations, according
to the refpeclive natures of the bodies they are impregnated with. Nay though
there feem lb great a diftance between quickfilver and vegetable fubftanccs, yet I
have fecn a mercury, that was prepared by the help of vegetables without metals
or minerals, which was very different from common quickfilver, by being more noble
than it.
Thc fecond thing I am to acquaint you with, is, that as divers bodies and methods
may be employed in thc preparation of noble mercuries (as I have newly obferved) fo
it feems very probable, that the common mercuries fo prepared may nave differing,
as well as noble qualities and ufes, not only in refpect of alchymy, but of medicine
;
as being fitted to have potent operations, as well upon human bodies, as the more
ftubborn ones of metals and minerals. I am not indeed at all forward to recommend
the needleli ufe of mercurial medicines, of which we may too often lee bad effects,
if they be not as wdl prudently and cautiouffy given, as faithfully and fkilfully prepared
: but fincc wc fee, that, in fpight of llelmont, very many learned and experienced
phyficians allow themfelves to employ, frequently enough, even the vulgar
preparations of common mercury, fome of which prove indeed oftentimes in fome
ftubborn difeafes far more efficacious than ordinary medicines ; I fee not, why we may
not hope for greater and more innocent effects from a mercury well purified and impregnated
with the fulphur and finer parts of fuch bodies, as volatile gold, or Venus,
or Mars, or antimony, L?c. And though, as I lately told you, I found fui h animated
mercuries far more indilpofed than common quickfilver, to make a precipitate with
corporal gold •, yet this need not hinder, but that divers other preparations may be
made, as well with impregnated, as with vulgar mercury ; fuch as are turbith mineral,

mercury made up with fit ingredients (as in thofe, that are by fome called the blue
and the black pill) and efpecially the cinnabar made by fubliming quickfilver and
fulphur into a purely red fubftancc, which, though wont to be employed chiefly by
painters, ought not perhaps to be ncglcdted by phyficians ; fince even in ordinary
cinnabar dy vulgar mercury is fo bridled by the common fulphur, that unlcfe too frequently
given without paufes, or in an indilcreet dofe, it has not been ufually found to
lalivate, yet docs often lie not idle nor ufelefe in the body : fo that it may be well worth
trying, whether a noble cinnabar may not be obtained by fubftituting animated mercury
for vulgar, efpecially if inftead of common fulphur one lhould employ that of
antimony, or of antimony and vitriol, which I have elfewhere (hewn to make.
The third and laft advertifement I will give you, (hall be, that you arc not haftily
to conclude, that a mercury, that has been carefully depurated and impregnated, has
not been well prepared, if you find it not readily to elevate corporal gold, as it may
feem by the paft difcourfc, that mod of the animated mercuries I have mentioned
did. For though it be true, that I have had fome mercuries fitted to penetrate gold
fo far, and mix with it fo clofely, that it would quickly upon diftillation vifibly carry
up fome of that ponderous metal with it •, yet fo much is not to be expected from all
mercuries, that may lay claim to the title of animated or noble. For I have found,
that fome even of thefe may require a ftrong deco&ion to incorporate them intimately
with gold and I remember, that once, for trial-fake, I made mercury,
which upon bare diftillation would not at all colour the glafs : I made, I fay, this
mercury, by decoding or circulating it with the gold for ten days or a fortnight,
unite fo clofely with the metal, that it would afterwards elevate enough of it to gild
die in fide of the glafs ; and by a much longer decoction I have fometimes had the
gold lodged copioufly in the upper part, and even in the neck of confiderably tall
glafs-eggs, hermetically fcaled, one or two of which I can yet Ihew you.

OF the leveral fubftances, that chymifts obtain by the fire from mixt bodies?
that, which they call phlegm or water, and would have men look upon as mere
water, feparated by a preceding analyfis, fecms to die Helmontians, and divers other
modern artifts, to bid the faireft for the title of elementary and primordial. Wherefore
it will now be fit to confider, whether, about that alfo, we may not juftly retain
fome doubts, and rationally luipec't, that all, that they call the phlegm of bodies,
was not in the form of elememary fimple water, pre-exiftcnt in the body, whence it
is obtained ; but that even fuch portions of matter, as many of thole, that pafj
among chymifts for phlegms, may be produced either by the operation of the fire,
or by other ways.

6$2 The Producible n p. ss
In order to this inquiry, it will be Bt to premife fomething again ft the prefumed
fimplicity and homogeneity of the liquors, whereto the Spagyrifts give, in common,
the name of phlegm ; that in cale fome of the produced liquors we fipeak of (hall be
denied to be prccilely of an elementary nature, it may appear, that that ought not to
hinder us from allowing them the name of phlegm, provided that they be not remoter
from fimplicity, than thofe, to which chymifts grant that appellation.
And firft, 1 confidcr, that befidcs thofe qualities, that arc common with water to
divers other liquors confeffedly not fimple, as tranfparency, want of colour, aptnefs
to be imbibed by moft lores of vegetable and animal fubftances ; the two qualities
upon whole account chymifts are wont to call a body phlegm or water, are its appearing
to them infipid, and its being of a volatile and fugitive nature.
I further confidcr, dut not only divers of thole liquors, that pafs for phlegm,
will yield a tafte fcnfible enough to him, that will hold them with attention of mind,
for a competent time, in his mouth, but that the criterion of liquors by the tafte is
nothing near lb certain as many think. For, not to mention, that it is plain, that
fome kinds of dogs, as fetters, fpaniels, and blood-hounds, take notice of many
things by their odours, that we men have no perception of by our fmelling, which
may argue, that our fenfes may not be moved with objects, that would affect them,
if they were of a more delicate contexture , not to mention this, I fay, it is plain,
that tl it- fubtlety of the fenfe of tailing differs among men themfelves. And thofe
that drink nothing but water, will often tell us of a great difparity betwixt common
water, wherein other men find not any. And I remember, that when once I did,
though but for fome months, confine myfclf to drink water, I could diftinguilh the
limpid waters of differing places, almoft as manifeftly as I now diflinguilh beers,
which, after 1 fell again to drink wine and other liquors, I ceafed to be able to do.
The confidcration of quickfilver may, methinks, let us fee, that it is poflible for
a grols and fluid body, that is far from elementary water, to be infipid. For quickfilver
is without queftion a fluid, and at leaft in reference to fome bodies, gold, filvcr,
and fome others, a liquor ; fince it foaks into their pores, and foftens the bodies.
The fame quickfilver may alfo fcrve to (hew, by its difpofition to fly away in the fire,
that volatility, even in conjunction with infipidnefs, is no certain mark of an elementary
or fimple, nor confequently of a primordial body. And indeed, fince volatility
depends mainly upon the extraordinary minutenefs of the panicles, whereof a
body confifts, and on their being incoherent, and of fhapes fitted for motion ; this
quality may be acquired by fo many differing ways, and be found in bodies otherwife
of fuch differing natures, that unlefs it be found affociated with the other qualities
proper to phlegm, it will be but an unfure argument, to prove the body, that
it belongs to, to be elementary, and not to have been by compofition, divifion, or
tranfpofition produced.
If it be true, as the Cartefians will have it, that water confifts of particles, that,
Jikc little eejs, are long and extremely flender, and confequently flexible , I fee nor
any impofiibility, that the various action of the fire, upon the minute parts of a
body, and that, which it may caufe the corpuicles of one body to have upon thofe of
another, may produce water, that did not in the form of water prc-exift in the body,
that alfords it : for it feems to me poffible enough, that the particles, whereof a corporeal
mats is made up, may have fuch fhapes, fizes, and contextures, that by the
various agitation, which the pervading corpufcles of the fire may produce amongft
them, whatever edges and points they had before, may by mutual attrition of the
t orpufclcs be worn off, and by the fame means fo much of the fubftance may be worn
away,

•way, that what remains, cannot but be very flexible, and by all thefe qualifications
become fit to make a particle of water. As a bar of iion may, by divers ftrokes of
the wedge and hammer flcilfully employed, be divided into long and (lender parts,
whofe edges and points being blunted, they may be reduced into flender, and every
Way flexible wires. But not to build on fpeculations, let us proceed to fome experiments,
which afford phenomena, that feem favourable to out hypothefis.
Amongst the bodies, about which chymiftry is converfant, thofe that feem to be
the mod indifpofed to be turned into water, are the metalline, and mineral ones : fo
that if it can be made appear, that any of this fort can be changed into an aqueous
liquor, it will make it highly probable, that aqueous liquors may be by chymical
operations produced, efpecially in vegetable and animal bodies •, which feem far more
fufceptible of fuch a change, than the llubborn fubje&s of the mineral kingdom.
And fince quickfilver is by many learned men, as well chymifts as others, looked upon
as one of the few moft indeftruftible bodies in nature, and by its great pondcroulncfs,
in which it exceeds all the known bodies of the world fave one, is fo much the more
remote from fuch a liquor as water, that has not the fixtetmh part of its fpecific
weight ; if quickfilver ltfelf can in great part be turned into an aqueous liquor, it
will not a little favour the do&rine propofed in thefe notes v for which reafon I (hall
fubjoin the enfuing ftory.
Relating to a very ingenious and fober phyfician of my acquaintance what had
befallen me in diftilling mercury, from whence 1 once obtained a water without additament,
without being able to make the like experiment afterwards fuccecd i he affurcd
me, that he had a friend of his, had fome years paft provided a very large
Dutch retort of good earth, furnifhed with a pipe of about a foot long, to cart in the
mercury at ; and that having by little and little conveyed through that pipe a pound
of quickfilver into the cadent retort, they obtained four ounces of water, and loft
in fpite of their care two ounces of matter (whatever it were) the remaining part of
the pound having been elevated in the form of mercury. And when 1 fuggefted,
that perhaps the water, that came over, was afforded by the aqueous particles of the
earthen retort itfelf, he replied, that, to prevent their being impoled on, they had
been careful not to put on the receiver, till the retort had been made throughly glowing
hot : and that this liquor was far from common water, he thought to be paft
doubt by that, which follows. For I having acquainted him with an odd trial or two,
I had made with mercurial water, and alked him, whether he found the like effects
from his, he told me, that his friend and he poured both their J il tilled mercury and
their water into a kind of China cup, and though it were in June, left it open in a
garret for two or three days, upon a prefumption his friend had, that this mercurial
water thus ordered would turn a good part of the quickfilver into its own nature, and
and fo multiply itfelf upon it. But when they came to vifit their cup again, they 0
were much furprifed to find their water all gone, and that the greateft part thereof
was turned again into mercury ; which they concluded from this, that they miffed
upon the balance but about half an ounce of the whole matter j which (half ounce)
they fuppofrd to have been loft by evaporation •, the other three ounces and a half
being round in the incrcafed weight of the mercury.
The mention I have made of quickfilver, puts me in mind of an argument ad
hominem, that may deferve to be confidcred by the chief feci: of modern chymifts,
the Hclmontians : for if it be true, which their mafter teaches, that by his liquor
alkaheft, not only quickfilver, but all other tangible bodies, may be reduced into
infipid water, jult like rain water, 1 may be allowed to infer, that water may be produced,
The Producible ness
duced, fincc fait and fulphur themfelves may be turned into water. I know the Helmontians
may anfwer, that this is not lb much a production, as a reduction •, fince all
things confifting originally of water, thealkaheft does but deprive it of the dilguifes,
that feminal principles put it into, to make it appear, un.'er the form of gold, quickfilvcr,
plants, animals, iSc. But this anfwer may be elfcwhcre further examined : for
the prelcnt, it may perhaps be fuffkicnt to reply, that even by this anfwer it is granted to
appear by experiment, that water has been eopioufly produced out of mineral bodies,
but it has not yet been made appear, that thofc bodies were produced out of water.
But this is not all, nor perhaps the principal thing I have to fay in favour of the
opinion pleaded for in thefe notes. For iuppofing bodies by being reduced, by the
alkaheft and the fire, into an infipid liquor, were really deduced into water, yet the
Helmontians would not fully fatisfy me. For Helmont relates, that by abftracting
his immortal liquor from (tones, or fuch kinds of bodies, he turns them into fait
equiponderant to the concrete ; which fait by further operations he reduces, as he fuppofes,
into elementary water. Since then he Hops not at fait, but goes to a further
tranfnuitation, and concludes, that a (lone doth not confill of fait, becaule that fait
may, by further operations, be turned into infipid water ; he mull give me leave, on
the fame ground, to argue, that infipid water is not the firft matter of bodies, fince.
by a further operation of the fire, that liquor itfelf may be, at lead in great part,
turned into earth. For I elfewhere relate fome experiments of my own anda friend's,
in which clear water, divers times very flowly diflilled out of clear glafs bodies, left
every time a terrcftrial powder at the bottom : as if (in cafe water be fo homogeneous
a fubftance as is fuppoted) the whole body of the water might, by reiterated diftillations,
wichout violence of the fire, be reduced into earth j whereof I remember,
in the lad trial of mine, I had enough to cover the bottom of a large cucurbit, out
of which the dillillations had been made.
And on this occafion, I (hall add a trial, which feems to argue, that without the
help of often repeated dillillations in tall cucurbits, clear water itfelf may, by the
operation of the fire, be changed into anodier body.
We took, then, very pure and limpid water, which had, by our pneumatic engine,
been carefully freed from the aerial particles, that are wont to be harboured in
the pores of that liquor : this in a new bolt-head of fuch a fize, that the matter might
have room to play and circulate, we fcaled up hermetically •, and placing the vcficl in
a digeftivc furnace, we left it there above a year, and obferved, as we expected, that
after it had continued for a good while, there began to form themfelvcs, in the water,
little concretions heavier than it, which in procefs of time incrcafed in magnitude,
and, as we thought, in number; making a kind of terra foliata, that confided of a
, multitude of little thin films (or fcalcs like thofe of the fmallcrfort of fifties) which,
when the glafs was (haken in an enlightened place, were eopioufly difperfed through
the body of the liquor, and appeared varioufly and vividly coloured, being fome of
them almoft as big as fpangles, and more glittering : and when the agitation ceafed,
they prefently fell to the bottom, which they covered in the form of a terrafoliata
by their fubfidence manifefting themfelvcs to be notably heavier, in fpecie, than the
water they had been formed of. And the longer the glad was kept in the digeftive
furnace, the more of this fine terreftrial fubftance was produced : and left the effect
mould be afcribed to the abftraction of the air from the water, handled as is before
related, I (hall add, that we produced the like fubftance, though, as it feemed, not
fo eopioufly, after the like manner, in water, that had not at all been freed from air.

OF all the fubftances obtainable from mixt bodies, that which, to perfons not
prepofleffed with Helmontian opinions, may feem the molt fimple, elementary,
and unchangeable, is that, which they call earth or terra damnata ; becaufe there is
fuppofed to be no doubt, but that the calcining or incinerating violence of the fire,
mutt not only have driven away the mercurial and other volatile parts, but mull alio
have quite burnt out the fulphurs, which oftentimes are more fixt than the reft j as
the water on the other fide muft have duTolved away all the alkali or fixt fait.
This ratiocination, I confefs, is very fpecious and probable, but yet not fo fatiffactory,
but that a fceptic may retain not irrational doubts about the cogency of it,
upon fuch conliderations, as I am now going to propofe.
And I will begin with confidering, that, whereas the things, wherein this fuppofed
fimplicity, and unchangeablenels of the earthy part of mixt bodies, is founded,
are thefe three : its not duTolving in water its not affecYing the tafte ; and its not
having flown away from the incinerated body, that afforded it ; it may with probability
be doubted, whether any of thefe, or all of them put together, do neceflarily
evince what chymifts pretend they do.
And In the firft place, according to the different conftitutions of certain forts of
bodies, I think it fit to make a diftinclion between the dry and heavy parts, that remain
after a body has been expofed to the violence of the fire, and, if need be, freed
from its fait, as much as it can be, by the affufion of water. For it is evident, that
in fome bodies, efpccially of a metalline nature, the fire, that makes that which they
call calcination, does not operate as it does in the burning of vegetables. For, befides
that fometimes almoft (and fometimes more than almoft, the whole weight of a
mineral is to be found in that which they call its calx, and is manifeft in the calcination
of lead and tin per ft (if Ikilfully performed) the calx is in great part reducible
fometimes into a body of the fame nature with that, which afforded it, and fometimes
into fome other body, very far from being elementary : as is manifeft -partly in the
reduction of minium (which is calx of lead madc/vr ft) which, as to the greateft
part of it, we have more than once, by the bare way of ordering the fire, reduced in
a very ftiort time, and without additaments, into malleable lead ; and partly in the
calces or (as they alfo fpeak) afties of antimony, which by bare fuGon arc cafily reduced
into glals, w hence we have fometimes obtained an antimonial regulus. So that
it is manifeft, that there is a great deal of difference, between the aflies (taking that
word in a large fenfe) of metals, and of fome minerals, where almoft the whole body
is by the lire converted into a dry and heavy powder, and the aflies of incinerated
vegetables, which ufually leave but a little quantity of earth behind them, in comparifon
of the matter, which the violence of the fire hath driven away.
But

65 6 The Prod ucibleness
But fctting afide the above-mentioned metalline calces, which without queftion
remain compounded bodies, if metals themfelves be fo •, and to forbear examining,
whether they be not further compounded with rorpufcles of the fire, or fuel, that are
embodied with them: I confider, that the qumities, which make other alhes pafs for
elementary earth, may be produced in portions of matter, that arc not fimple, either
by compofition or change of texture.
I have elfcwhere occafion to take notice of bodies, which, though, when they are
fingle, they will eafily diflblve in water, yet the rcfult of them will not : and you may
find inftances of this kind, among the magifteries, as chymifts call them, made of
feveral bodies, by precipitating their folutions (made in acid liquors) with oil of tartar
per dcliquium.
From oil of vitriol and fpirit of wine, though both moft readily diflbluble in
water, we have, by bare digeftion and diftillation, obtained a pretty quantity of a
fubftance, that we found not to diflblve in water, and which fecmed to be infipid and
fixt enough.
There are (tones, fome more and feme lefs precious, which though I could by the
help of the fire deprive of their colour, and bring to a white powder ; yet it did not
appear to me, that they were really calcined, or would in water yield any fait : fo that
if thefe (tones be compounded bodies, as Spagyrifts tell us they are, we fee, that
there may be other corpufcles befides metalline ones, which though reduced by the
help of the fire to a white powder, infipid, and not diflbluble in water, are yet remote
enough from an elementary nature.
But I need fcek no further, for inftances of this kind, fince Spagyrifts themfelves
teach us, that the alhes of wood may, by the violence of the fire, be turned into
glafs which being a body compofed of the earthy and faline part of the alhes (for
they tell us, that earth fcparated from the fait will never be vitrified) mud be according
to their own confeflion a compounded body : which being at laft made by the
utmoft violence of the fire, muft be fixed, indiflbluble in water, and confequently
infipid. And without taking this vitrification upon the chymifts authority, it is
manifeft, that in glafs made the common way, there is a great deal of borellia, fid
alkali, or other lixiviate fait mixt with the land : as is evident, not only becaufe artificers
find the fait needful to diflblve the fand, and bring it to fufion, but becaufe
the glafs ufes to weigh very much more, fometimcs (as an ingenious mailer of a glafshoul'e
anfwercd me) thirty, or forty pound in an hundred, than the fand, that was
put in.
I shall add, that, fince chymifts afcribe all odours to fulphur, I may reafonably
conclude againft them, that in fpite of all the violent fire, which is required to the
making common glafs, there is (tore of folphur, as well as fait in it. For I have
often tried, that by barely rubbing two large j>ieces of glafs, one againft another,
there would quickly be produced a ftrong oficnfive fmcll. And yet glafs, which
thus appears to be, not only a compounded, but a decompounded body, fince the
land or cugali (as the Venetian glafs-mcn call their pebbles) or other Itones being
themfelves mixt bodies, are further compounded with the lairs that diflblve them :
glafs, I fay, is a body, th.it manifeftly poflefles all thtfe three qualities, which chymifts
require in their earth, being taftelcls, indiflbluble in the water, and fixed in the
fire. And if alhes alone be (as chymifts teach us they arc) capable of vitrification
(and indeed an inquifitive owner of a glafe-houfe anfwered me, that once, if he much
mif-remembcrcd not, he made, but not eafily, glafs of alhes alone without fand ;) how

that which is called the Gmple earth, may not be a body compounded of two or
more fubftanccs, which by their coalition, and new texture produced by the action
of the fire, have been brought to a kind of vitrification, or otherwife have acquired
the few obvious qualities, that chymifts are wont to think fufficient to give a production
of the fire, the name of earth ?
It is obvious to obferve, that divers bodies, when they come to be of lenfible
bulk, will fink in liquors, in which their corpufclcs would freely fwim, if fo many
of them did not flick together. As of fait and fugar, the lumps, and even the
grains, whilft they remain fuch, will fall to the bottom of water, in which when they
are difperfed into minute and invifible corpufcles, they will eafily fwim. And I have
obferved, that in ftopt glafies fome falts, and other bodies, that for many months
remained undiftinguiihed in the liquors, that harboured them, would in trad of time
have conventions made of their particles, that would then fubfide, and be no more
carried up and down by the particles of the liquor. And I fee no impofiibility, that
fomcwhat of this kind may happen to the particles, whereof water conflits : for if
fome of thefe, by frequent occurfions and attritions come to apply themfelves to one
another, fo as to have a fuller, and more immediate contact than formerly, and to be
intangled among themfelves, and perhaps alfo to exclude fome very thin and fubtile
air, that may be fufpected to lurk about them, and contribute to their fuftentation
if, I fay, this union, or ftricl adhefion of aqueous corpufclcs, (hall happen to be
made, the aggregates or clufters, though as to lenfe but very fmall, may be too great
and unwieldy to be any longer parts of water, but may fubfide in that liquor-, and
if their union or adhefion be find enough, they will upon the fame account be unfit
to be carried up in the form of vapours, and exhalations by heat, and lb may be like
earth fixed in the fire, as well as not difibluble in water.
I have fometimes alfo had a fulpicion, that the production of an earthy fubftance
in water may be furthered by the particles of fire, that are employed to make it circulate
; and that of thofe igneous particles, which, as I am apt to think, pervade the
glafs, fome of the grolfer, or rather the lefs fubtile, may in their pafiage fallen themselves
to lbme aqueous particles, fitted to adhere to them, and may with thefe begin
to make fome invifible concretions ; to which afterwards, other congruous particles
may, little by little, (lick, in their pafiage, and fo at length compofe lenfible aggregates
of powder : which may be illuftrated by what happens in the precipitation of
quickfilver without addition, where the mercurial particles being aflbciatcd by, and
probably with fome of thofe of the fire, begin to form concretions, at firft very
minute, which afterwards increafe more and more, by the accefiion of other adhering
particles, till all the mercury, or the greatcft part of it be reduced, from a fluid
body, to a red powder. And perhaps it may countenance my conjecture, about the
production of an earthy fubftance, by a brifk concurrence of the particles of fire, if
I add, that though I have kept high rectified fpirit of wine for above a year together
hermetically fealcd, and for the molt part of that time in a digeflive furnace, widiout
finding any earthy refidence ; yet, when I ordered a bolt-head, that, though it were
hermetically fealcd, the alcohol of wine that was put into it might be boiled without
breaking the glafs, I found, that in a fhort time this liquor would afford a not inconfidcrable
quantity of fuch a fubfiding talcky fubftance, as I obtained from the water,
formerly mentioned. But thefe things I need propofc but as illuftrations, that may
fomewhat help you, to conceive how water may be turned into earth. For, whether
it be by thefe, or any other ways, that the thing is performed, yet fincc the experiment
formerly recited, that water by frequent cohobations may be more and more

turned into earth, argues the matter of fact, our not being able to explicate the manner,
does not hinder the thing from being true, nor the argument we build on it from
being good : fincc even water, to which, by fomc operations of the fire and the alkaheft,
ic is pleaded, that bodies are ultimately reduced, may itfelf by a further and
very fimple operation of the fire be reduced into earth.
1 have fomewhere mentioned, for I remember not in what paper I have obferved,
falt-petre diftilled with clay, to lofe much more of its weight, than can be fuppofed
to have afcended in the form cither of fpirit or phlegm. And now to make this experiment
more fhort and cafy, I (hall add, that I lately made it in a crucible (inftcad
of a retort) wherein a double weight of finely powdered tobacco-pipe clay, very well
mixt with pulverized cryftals of nitre, were kept three hours, in a violent fire, and
then the mixture being taken out, the remaining fixt fait was carefully extracted, but
amounted to very litde in comparifon of what nitre was wont to yield, when calcined
with charcoal. And that this leant proportion of fixt fait did not proceed chiefly from
a very copious avolation of nitrous fubftance, appeared probable by this, that the
caput mortuum was much more ponderous, than was to be expected, upon the fcore
of the tobacco-pipe clay, that was firft employed, and the alkali, that was extracted j
fo that the new weight acquired by the clay feemed manifeftly to proceed from the
acceflion of a portion of the falt-petre, that by this operation was turned into earth.
Infomuch, that of fix drachms, that four ounces of clay had acquired in weight,
after the crucible was taken out, not fo many grains could even by boiling water be
obtained from the whole caput mortuum : which, when firft taken out of the crucible,
was almoft quite infipid.
That earth may be dt novo produced, may likewife be probably argued from the
experiment I formerly related about the deftruction of the fait of tartar, by igniting'
it, and putting it into fair water ; for there remained after the numerous filtratiorts,
and, if I mifremcmbcr not, after every one of them, a fubftance in the filter, which,
for aught appears, may be as well called earth, as that, which was leparatcd from the
calcined tartar, the firft time it was put in the water, to divide the fait from the earth.
For in our experiment, as well as in the common operation I come from mentioning,
the way of proceeding is the fame, and in both there remains in the filter a fubftance,
which, by its (laying there, (hews it was not difibluble in the water, and which
before it came thither, (hewed, by its enduring a violent fire, that it was alio fixt as
earth ought to be. Nor would it much move me, if it fliould be found, that this factitious
earth may have fome fuch operation upon fomc particular body, as is not thought
to belong to true elementary earth. For fincc it is obtained by a chymical analylis,
if it have thofc qualities, that in the general eftimations of naturalifts make up the
notion of what they call earth ; I think that ought to fufficc us, at leaft till the chymifts
give us fome accurate notion of genuine earth, and lhew us fuch a thing, and
teach us a better way of analyfis, to obtain it.
For in many bodies, that are, without fcmplc, looked upon as earth, I obferve
qualities, that do not belong to the received notion of elementary earth. This 1 1*ay,becaufe
I fee not, why fuch a texture, as will fuflice to make a portion of matter indiffoluble
in water, fixt in the fire, and infipid upon the tongue, may not alio make it
fit to operate actively upon fome bodies, and modify the operation of fome others,
that aft upon it. And if our earth from fait of tartar be rejected as fpurious, they
ought to confefs the infufficiency of their common way of feparating a true earth
from the bodies they analyze : for it feems calcination, and folution in water, and filtration,
which make up their ufual method, will not fufiice to make our earth of

tartar pafs for true ; though it appear not to be near fo remote from an elementarynature,
as fome other bodies, that are obtained from earth by the vulgar analyfis.
Of which I (hall at the clofe of thefe notes give an inftance, in well-dulcified quicklime,
which, according to the doftrine of the chymifts, ought to be an elementary
earth ; and yet feems not more fo, (if it be fo much) as our earth from fait of tartar.
And for the prefent, I fhall add, that the caput mortuum of vitriol remaining after it
had long endured a violent fire, though it were diligently freed from faltnels by reiterated
ablutions with hot water, was yet far from being an elementary earth v as
appearcth not only by its deep purplifh colour, and its ponderoufnefs, far exceeding
that of earth, but by a trial, that I purpofely made to examine it.
Upon this occafion I remember, that a learned man of my acquaintance, who
vifited the mines of Hungary (and dealt much in Hungarian vitriol) affirmed to me,
when I told him I conceived the caput mortuum of it to retain much of the metalline
nature, that he had, upon a certain occafion, out of the colcothar of a certain fort
of Hungarian vitriol, not only received a pretty deal of good copper, but feparated
from that copper a pretty portion of filver, and fome grains of true gold.
Before I put a period to thefe notes about earth, though my argument do not
need nor require, that I mould do it, yet upon this fair occafion I mall here take
leave to doubt, whether fuch an elementary earth, as the fchools tell us of, do yet
appear to be more than a notional thing. For to what I have already faid concerning
the earths fuppofed to be produced by chymical analyfes, I fhall now add, that I have
not yet feen it proved, that nature docs, any more than art, afford us a true elementary
earth j at leafl I can fay, that fome, which feem to be of the more fimple fort,
I found upon examination to have qualities not afcribed to pure earth. For though
tobacco-pipe clay, by reafon of its fixity, whitenefs, and infipidnefs, and its lying
oftentimes deep enough beneath the i'urf ace of the ground, may, as probably as almoft
any other native earth we know, be looked upon as elementary j yet tobaccopipes
well baked may fomctimes be made to ftrikc fire. And I have more than once
tried, that by brifkly rubbing two pieces of a new tobacco-pipe, one againft another,
they would in a minute or two of an hour grow warm •, and being" immediately fmclt
to, manifeftly afford a rank odour, between fulphureous and bituminous, almoft
like that, which proceeds from pebbles or fl'nts, when they are rubbed hard
againft one another. As if tobacco-pipe clay were not a true earth, but a fine whit?
fand, conlifting of grains too fmall to be diftinftly taken notice of, like thole of
other fand. On which occafion I fhall add, that I found, by a hydroftatical trial,
that its fpecific gravity was but little differing from that of pebbles, its proportion n
weight to water of the fame bulk being as two and a quarter to one. A tobaccopipe
may alio be lbmewhat melted by a very vehement fire (for a lefs will fcarce ferve
the turn) as may be argued from this, that it may by fuch a fire be brought to bend.
Poitcti-ANE, or the matter, whereof China dilhts are made, is not, as (bme travellers
and learned men h;;ve fondly imagined, a con-pofition, that requires to be
buried under ground, for 1 know not how many years, to ripen it into pnrcelane \
but as fome late authors inform us, and as I have been afTurcd by a perfbn, that went
purpofely to that place in China, that is fo famous for the making of porcekne veffels,
it is a pure fort of clay •, but yet this I find not to be elcirentaiy earth. For
befides that I have obferved, that a violent fire will make it fomewhat melt; 1 find,
that with fteel it will calily enough ftrikc fire almofl like a Mint. The lik 1 have
obferved in porcellane very artificially imita:cd with a fort of Knglifh ciay. And I
found too, that the matter even of dark-coloured jugs of the better fort, and well
4 I' 2 baked,
66o lie Producibleness
baked, would with a fleel afford fparks of fire. I forgot to tell you, when I was
fpcaking or* fine porcelane, that I found its fpecific gravity to be very near the fame
with that of flints, and tobacco-pipe clay. But I remember I went once to vifit a
grove or pit, where at the depth ot divers yards, they were wont to dig up a certain
white earth, which diflilled, by an acquaintance of mine, afforded a liquor, that was
put into my hand to try, and which I found to be very rich in a volatile fait, that
tailed and fmelt much like fpirit of urine, or hartfhom, and had almofl the fame
effects in changing the colours of fome bodies, and precipitating of others. I remember
too, that I found by the operation of a mcnflruum or two upon tripoli, that»
as white and pure a virgin earth as it feemed, yet it was not elementary: and, on
the other fide, a matter of fome Englifh mines having prcfented me, among other
minerals, which he knew not what to make of, a very white fubffance, whereof he
had (tore, which he thought an earth, and which was judged by an excellent artificer,
much converlant with tripoli, to be finer even than that earth, I gucfled it upon examination
to be a kind of talc, whofe leaves were exceeding fine and minute. The
refulc of thefc relations may be, not only, that we may yet retain our doubts, whether
the alienors of elementary earth can fhew us any native fubflance, that deferves
that name; but alio, whether thofe things, that remain after chymical analyfcs,
though they have all the qualities, that are judged fufficicnt to denominate a portion
of matter, earth, may not yet either be compounded bodies, or be endowed with
qualities, which belong not to fimplc earth. To explain and confirm which, I ffiall
give an inftancc in fome quick-lime, that I purpofely examined. For though it had
been, by frequent ablutions in warm water, carefully dulcified, and fo was as well
infipid, as fixt, and indiflbluble in water; yet I found, I could readily diflblve it in
divers menflruums, and even fpirit of vinegar : whereas true elementary earth ought
to be as well indiflbluble in fuch liquors as in water.
If I had not been to deal with chymifls, but Ariflotelians, I might have faved myfelf
the labour of folicitoufly endeavouring to prove, that earth and water may each
of them be produced from bodies of a differing nature from it. For though the
Peripatetics will not allow the whole elements to nave been produced, became they
look upon them as integrant parts of the world, which Arijlotle laborioufly (though
not totally) maintains to be eternal-, yet the portions of the elements they will have
to be interchangeably tranfmutablc. So that what was once water may be earth, and
earth may, by intermediate alterations, be turned into water.
But thofe I have to do with, being the vulgar chymifls, who will have the material
principles or fimple ingredients of mixt bodies co-eval with the world, and uncapable
of being either deflroyed or produced ; it was not allowable for me to proceed upon
the Ariftotclian hypothefu, of the tranfmutablenefs of what they call elements ; cfpecially
becaufe, that though I do admit it, as it is, according to my opinion, a
part of a more general truth ; yet I do not think, they have well proved it by their
argumcnts : which fince I myfelf do not like, I think it were dif-tngenuous to prefs '
them upon others. And without having recourfe to their dodrine, there will occur
fome other particulars, that may be added to thofe already mentioned, to countenance
the produciblcncfs of the principles of mixt bodies, in fome other papers, that are
to follow thefc notes ; though in flri&ncfs I was not obliged to fay fo much, as I have
already faid, fince pretending to call in qucflion no more than the three hypoflatical
principles of the chymifls, I might eafily have excufed myfelf for having let alone
the production of water and earth ; fince the generality of chymifls reckon not thofe
bodies amongfl their hypoflatical principles, but look upon them, as receptacles, or.

as others would have them recrements of thefc, or as on fome other account,
related to them. But I was not willing to omit water and earth, becaule fome
of the more learned of the modern Spayyrilts have adopted them into the number
of the principles of mixt bodies ; and becaule I find by experience, that in chymical
analyfcs they arc at leaft as often to be met with, as fome of the principles
confeffcdly hypoftatical. But what has been delivered about earth and
water having much added to the bulk of thefe notes, it is time I mould put a period
to this part of them,' in reference to which I hope it will be confidercd, that I do not
pretend, that every fingle experiment by me alleged does fu/ficicntly prove, that the
body obtained by it was in the ftridbrft fenfe produced. For if the feverdl experiments,
and other proofs, do in conjunction, and, as it were in a body, make up a good argument,
that the ingredients they relate to, may be produced ; it is as much as will,
1 hope, be expected from thefe notes, which having been written by way of appendix
to the Sceptical Cbymifl, may be allowed, as well as that book, to employ fome proofs,
not altogether cogent, and may be judged not improper, though lome of the arguments
propofed in them, to Ihew, that chymical principles arc not all ingcncrable and
indeftruiftible, mould be but mccrly probable. And yet this I mail venture to intimate,
that vulgar chymifts ana" Ariftotelians may nor, perchance, find it fo cafy a
thing, as it is like many of them will imagine, to confute divers paflages of the foregoing
trail •, fmce probably their objections will fuppofe fomething or other, which,
though taken for granted among them, and perhaps by feveral other learned men, I
do not admit as true, or think demonftrable, but rather qiieftionable, upon very
rational grounds. And though perhaps I lhould not have brought in fome of the
experiments mentioned in the preceding notes, if I had not had a mind to throw together
what I thought might contribute to fo ufeful a thing, as a natural hiftory of
chymical principles, on which others, if not I, may hereafter ground a theory of
them yet this may alfo deferve to be confidered, that if any of the foregoing experiments,
though never fo few, do really prove (as it is like fome of them will be
judged to do) that any one of the chymical principles may be, de novo, produced ,
that alone will fuffice to deftroy the univerfality and intireneft of their hypothefis \ and:
befides give caufe to fufpeft, that by further induftry, the produciblends of other
principles alfo may be difcovcrcd.
